QGIS has various capabilities for editing OGR, SpatiaLite, PostGIS,
MSSQL Spatial and Oracle Spatial vector layers and tables.

.. note::
   The procedure for editing GRASS layers is different - see section
   :ref:`grass_digitizing` for details.

.. tip:: **Concurrent Edits**

   This version of QGIS does not track if somebody else is editing the
   same feature at the same time as you are.
   The last person to save the edits wins.

.. _`snapping_tolerance`:

Setting the Snapping Tolerance and Search Radius
================================================

For optimal and accurate editing of vector layer geometries, we need
to set an appropriate value of snapping tolerance and search radius for
features vertices.

.. index:: Snapping tolerance

Snapping tolerance
------------------

When you add a new vertex or move an existing one, the snapping
tolerance is the distance QGIS uses to search for the closest vertex
or segment you are trying to connect to.
If you are not within the snapping tolerance, QGIS will leave the
vertex where you release the mouse button, instead of snapping
it to an existing vertex or segment.

The snapping tolerance setting affects all tools that work with tolerance.

You can enable / disable snapping by using the |snapping| :sup:`Enable
snapping` button on the :guilabel:`Snapping Toolbar` or pressing :kbd:`s`.
The snapping mode, tolerance value, and units can also be configured in
this toolbar.

The snapping configuration can also be set in
:menuselection:`Project --> Snapping Options...`.

There are three options to select the layer(s) to snap to:

* :guilabel:`All layers`: quick setting for all visible layers in the
  project so that the pointer snaps to all vertices and/or segments.
  In most cases, it is sufficient to use this snapping mode, but beware
  when using it for projects with many vector layers, as it may affect
  performance.
* :guilabel:`Current layer`: only the active layer is used, a convenient
  way to ensure topological consistency within the layer being edited.
* :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration`: allows you to enable and adjust
  snapping mode and tolerance on a layer basis (see figure_edit_snapping_).
  If you need to edit a layer and snap its vertices to another, make
  sure that the target layer is checked and increase the snapping
  tolerance to a higher value.
  Snapping will not occur to a layer that is not checked in the
  snapping options dialog.

As for snapping mode, you can choose between ``To vertex``, ``To segment``,
and ``To vertex and segment``.

The tolerance values can be set either in the project's ``map units``
or in ``pixels``.
The advantage of choosing ``pixels`` is that it keeps the snapping
constant at different map scales.
10 to 12 pixels is normally a good value, but it depends on the DPI of
your screen.
Using map units allows the tolerance to be related to real ground
distances.
For example, if you have a minimum distance between elements, this
option can be useful to ensure that you donâ€™t add vertices too close to
each other.

.. _figure_edit_snapping:

.. figure:: img/editProjectSnapping.png
   :align: center

   Snapping options (Advanced Configuration mode)

.. note::

   By default, only visible features (the features whose style is displayed,
   except for layers where the symbology is "No symbols") can be snapped.
   You can enable the snapping on invisible features by checking |unchecked|
   :guilabel:`Enable snapping on invisible features` under the
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Digitizing` tab.

.. tip:: **Enable snapping by default**

   You can set snapping to be enabled by default on all new projects in the
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Digitizing` tab.
   You can also set the default snapping mode, tolerance value, and units,
   which will populate the :guilabel:`Snapping Options` dialog.

.. index:: Snapping on intersections

Enable snapping on intersections
---------------------------------

Another available option is to use |snappingIntersection| :guilabel:`snapping on
intersection`, which allows you to snap to geometry intersections of
snapping enabled layers, even if there are no vertices at the intersections.

.. index:: Search radius

Search radius
--------------

:guilabel:`Search radius for vertex edits` is the distance QGIS uses
to ``search`` for the vertex to select when you click on the map.
If you are not within the search radius, QGIS will not find and select
any vertex for editing.
The search radius for vertex edits can be defined under the
:menuselection:`Settings -->` |options|
:menuselection:`Options --> Digitizing` tab (this is where you define
the snapping default values).

Snap tolerance and search radius are set in ``map units`` or ``pixels``.
You may need to experiment to get them right.
If you specify a too big tolerance, QGIS may snap to the wrong vertex,
especially if you are dealing with a large number of vertices in close
proximity.
The smaller the search radius, the more difficult it will be to hit
what you want to move.


.. index:: Topological editing
   single: Digitizing; Topology

Topological editing
===================

In addition to these snapping options, the :guilabel:`Snapping options...`
dialog (:menuselection:`Project --> Snapping options`) and the
:guilabel:`Snapping` toolbar allow you to enable / disable some other
topological functionalities.


.. index:: Shared polygon boundaries
   seealso: Shared polygon boundaries; Topology

Enable topological editing
--------------------------

The |topopologicalEditing| :sup:`Topological editing` button helps
when editing and maintaining features with common boundaries.
With this option enabled, QGIS 'detects' shared boundaries.
When you move common vertices/segments, QGIS will also move them in
the geometries of the neighboring features.

Topological editing works with features from different layers, as long
as the layers are visible and in editing mode.


.. index:: Avoid overlap
   seealso: Avoid overlap; Topology

Avoid overlap of new polygons
-----------------------------

When the snapping mode is set to ``Advanced configuration``, for polygon layers,
there's an option called |checkbox| :guilabel:`Avoid overlap`. This option
prevents you from drawing new features that overlap existing ones in the
selected layer, speeding up digitizing of adjacent polygons.

With avoid overlap enabled, if you already have one polygon, you can digitize
a second one such that they intersect. QGIS will then cut the second polygon to the
boundary of the existing one. The advantage is that you don't have to
digitize all vertices of the common boundary.

.. note:: If the new geometry is totally covered by existing ones, it gets
   cleared, and QGIS will show an error message.

.. warning:: **Use cautiously the** :guilabel:`Avoid overlap` **option**

   Since this option will cut new overlapping geometries of any polygon layer,
   you can get unexpected geometries if you forget to uncheck it when no longer
   needed.


Geometry Checker
-----------------

A core plugin can help the user to find the geometry invalidity. You can find
more information on this plugin at :ref:`geometry_checker`.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Automatic tracing

.. _tracing:

Automatic Tracing
-----------------

Usually, when using capturing map tools (add feature, add part, add
ring, reshape and split), you need to click each vertex of the feature.
With the automatic tracing mode, you can speed up the digitization
process as you no longer need to manually place all the vertices during
digitization:

#. Enable the |tracing| :sup:`Tracing` tool (in the :guilabel:`Snapping` toolbar)
   by pushing the icon or
   pressing :kbd:`T` key.
#. :ref:`Snap to <snapping_tolerance>` a vertex or segment of a feature
   you want to trace along.
#. Move the mouse over another vertex or segment you'd like to snap and,
   instead of the usual straight line, the digitizing rubber band
   represents a path from the last point you snapped to the current
   position.

   QGIS actually uses the underlying features topology to build the
   shortest path between the two points.
   Tracing requires snapping to be activated in traceable layers to build
   the path.
   You should also snap to an existing vertex or segment while digitizing
   and ensure that the two nodes are topologically connectable through
   existing features edges, otherwise QGIS is unable to connect them and
   thus traces a single straight line.
#. Click and QGIS places the intermediate vertices following the displayed
   path.

Unfold the |tracing| :sup:`Enable Tracing` icon and set the
:guilabel:`Offset` option to digitize a path parallel to the features
instead of tracing along them.
A positive value shifts the new drawing to the left side of the tracing
direction and a negative value does the opposite.

.. note:: **Adjust map scale or snapping settings for an optimal tracing**

   If there are too many features in map display, tracing is disabled to avoid
   potentially long tracing structure preparation and large memory overhead.
   After zooming in or disabling some layers the tracing is enabled again.

.. note:: **Does not add topological points**

   This tool does not add points to existing polygon geometries even
   if :guilabel:`Topological editing` is enabled.
   If geometry precision is activated on the edited layer, the resulting
   geometry might not exactly follow an existing geometry.

.. tip:: **Quickly enable or disable automatic tracing by pressing the**
   :kbd:`T` **key**

   By pressing the :kbd:`T` key, tracing can be enabled/disabled
   anytime (even while digitizing a feature), so it is possible to
   digitize parts of the feature with tracing enabled and other
   parts with tracing disabled.
   Tools behave as usual when tracing is disabled.


.. index:: Digitizing, Digitizing tools
   see: Editing; Digitizing
   seealso: Digitizing; Attribute table

.. _sec_edit_existing_layer:

Digitizing an existing layer
============================

By default, QGIS loads layers read-only. This is a safeguard to avoid
accidentally editing a layer if there is a slip of the mouse.
However, you can choose to edit any layer as long as the data provider
supports it (see :ref:`supported_format`), and the underlying data source
is writable (i.e., its files are not read-only).

.. tip:: **Restrict edit permission on layers within a project**

   From the
   :menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> Data Sources -->
   Layers Capabilities` table, you can choose to set any layer
   read-only regardless the provider permission.
   This can be a handy way, in a multi-users environment to avoid
   unauthorized users to mistakenly edit layers (e.g., Shapefile),
   hence potentially corrupt data.
   Note that this setting only applies inside the current project.

In general, tools for editing vector layers are divided into a
digitizing and an advanced digitizing toolbar, described in section
:ref:`sec_advanced_edit`.
You can select and unselect both under
:menuselection:`View --> Toolbars -->`.

Using the basic digitizing tools, you can perform the following
functions:

.. _table_editing:

Table Editing: Vector layer basic editing toolbar

Note that while using any of the digitizing tools, you can still
:ref:`zoom or pan <zoom_pan>` in the map canvas without losing the
focus on the tool.

All editing sessions start by choosing the |toggleEditing|
:sup:`Toggle editing` option found in the context menu of a given layer,
from the attribute table dialog, the digitizing toolbar or the
:menuselection:`Edit` menu.

Once the layer is in edit mode, additional tool buttons on the editing
toolbar will become available and markers will appear at the vertices
of all features unless
:guilabel:`Show markers only for selected features` option under
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options... --> Digitizing` menu is checked.

.. _tip_save_regularly:

.. tip:: **Save Regularly**

   Remember to |saveEdits| :sup:`Save Layer Edits` regularly.
   This will also check that your data source can accept all the changes.

.. index:: Adding features, Rubber band
.. _add_feature:

Adding Features
---------------

Depending on the layer type, you can use the |newTableRow| :sup:`Add Record`,
|capturePoint| :sup:`Add Point Feature`, |captureLine| :sup:`Add Line Feature`
or |capturePolygon| :sup:`Add Polygon Feature` icons on the toolbar to add new
features into the current layer.

To add a geometryless feature, click on the |newTableRow| :sup:`Add Record`
button and you can enter attributes in the feature form that opens.
To create features with the spatially enabled tools, you first digitize the
geometry then enter its attributes. To digitize the geometry:

#. Left-click on the map area to create the first point of your new feature.
   For point features, this should be enough and trigger, if required,
   the feature form to fill in their attributes. Having set the
   :ref:`geometry precision <digitizingmenu>` in the layer properties
   you can use :ref:`snap to grid <snap_to_grid>` here to create features
   based on a regular distance.
#. For line or polygon geometries, keep on left-clicking for each additional
   point you wish to capture or use :ref:`automatic tracing <tracing>`
   capability to accelerate the digitization.
   This will create consecutive straight lines between the vertices you
   place.

   .. note::
    Pressing :kbd:`Delete` or :kbd:`Backspace` key reverts the last
    node you add.

#. When you have finished adding points, right-click anywhere on the map area
   to confirm you have finished entering the geometry of that feature.

   .. note::
    While digitizing line or polygon geometries, you can switch back and forth
    between the linear :guilabel:`Add feature` tools and :ref:`circular string
    tools <add_circular_string>` to create compound curved geometries.

   .. tip:: **Customize the digitizing rubber band**

    While capturing polygon, the by-default red rubber band can hide underlying
    features or places you'd like to capture a point. This can be fixed by setting
    a lower opacity (or alpha channel) to the rubber band's :guilabel:`Fill Color`
    in :menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Digitizing` menu.
    You can also avoid the use of the rubber band by checking :guilabel:`Don't
    update rubber band during node editing`.

#. The attribute window will appear, allowing you to enter the information for
   the new feature. Figure_edit_values_ shows setting attributes for a fictitious
   new river in Alaska. However, in the :guilabel:`Digitizing` menu under the
   :menuselection:`Settings --> Options` menu, you can also activate:

   * |checkbox| :guilabel:`Suppress attributes pop-up windows after
     each created feature` to avoid the form opening;
   * or |checkbox| :guilabel:`Reuse last entered attribute values` to
     have fields automatically filled at the opening of the form and
     just have to type changing values.

.. index:: Vertex tool
.. _vertex_tool:

Vertex tool
-----------

.. note:: **QGIS 3 major changes**

    In QGIS 3, the node tool has been fully redesigned and renamed to *vertex tool*.
    It was previously
    working with "click and drag" ergonomy, and now uses a "click - click"
    workflow. This allows major improvements like taking profit of the advanced
    digitizing panel with the vertex tool while digitizing or editing objects of
    multiple layers at the same time.


For any editable vector layer, the
|vertexToolActiveLayer| :sup:`Vertex tool (Current Layer)` provides manipulation
capabilities of
feature vertices similar to CAD programs. It is possible to simply select
multiple vertices at once and to move, add or delete them altogether.
The vertex tool also supports
the topological editing feature. This tool is selection persistent, so when some
operation is done, selection stays active for this feature and tool.

It is important to set the property :menuselection:`Settings -->` |options|
:menuselection:`Options --> Digitizing -->` :guilabel:`Search Radius:`
|selectNumber| to a number greater than zero. Otherwise, QGIS will
not be able to tell which vertex is being edited and will display a warning.

.. _tip_vertex_markers:

.. tip:: **Vertex Markers**

   The current version of QGIS supports three kinds of vertex markers:
   'Semi-transparent circle', 'Cross' and 'None'. To change the marker style,
   choose |options| :menuselection:`Options` from the
   :menuselection:`Settings` menu, click on the :guilabel:`Digitizing`
   tab and select the appropriate entry.

Basic operations
................

.. index:: Nodes, Vertices, Vertex, Geometryless feature

Start by activating the |vertexToolActiveLayer| :sup:`Vertex Tool (Current Layer)`.
Red circles will appear when hovering vertices.

* **Selecting vertices**: You can select vertices by clicking on them one
  at a time holding :kbd:`Shift` key pressed, or by clicking and dragging a
  rectangle around some vertices. When a vertex is selected, its color changes
  to blue. To add more vertices to the current selection, hold down
  the :kbd:`Shift` key while clicking. To remove vertices from the selection,
  hold down :kbd:`Ctrl`.

* **Batch vertex selection mode**:
  The batch selection mode can be activated by pressing :kbd:`Shift+R`.
  Select a first node with one single click, and then hover **without clicking**
  another vertex. This will dynamically select all the nodes in
  between using the shortest path (for polygons).

  .. _figure_batch_select_vertex:

  .. figure:: img/vertex_batch_selection_mode.png
     :align: center

     Batch vertex selection using :kbd:`Shift+R`


  Press :kbd:`Ctrl` will invert the selection, selecting the longest
  path along the feature boundary.
  Ending your node selection with a second click, or pressing :kbd:`Esc`
  will escape the batch mode.

* **Adding vertices**: To add a vertex, a virtual new node appears on
  the segment center.
  Simply grab it to add a new vertex.
  A double-click on any location of the boundary also creates a new
  node.
  For lines, a virtual node is also proposed at both extremities of a
  line to extend it.

  .. _figure_vertex_add_node:

  .. figure:: img/vertex_add_node.png
     :align: center

     Virtual nodes for adding vertices

* **Deleting vertices**: Select the vertices and click the
  :kbd:`Delete` key.
  Deleting all the vertices of a feature generates, if compatible with
  the datasource, a geometryless feature. Note that this doesn't delete
  the complete feature, just the geometry part.
  To delete a complete feature use the |deleteSelectedFeatures|
  :sup:`Delete Selected` tool.

* **Moving vertices**: Select all the vertices you want to move, click
  on a selected vertex or edge, and click again on the desired new
  location.
  All the selected vertices will move together. If snapping is enabled,
  the whole selection can jump to the nearest vertex or line.
  You can use Advanced Digitizing Panel constraints for distance,
  angles, exact X Y location before the second click.

  .. _snap_to_grid:

  Here you can use the snap-to-grid feature. Having set a value for the
  :ref:`geometry precision <digitizingmenu>` in the layer properties,
  a grid appears on a zoom level according to the Geometry precision.

  .. _figure_vertex_snap_to_grid:

  .. figure:: img/vertex_snap_to_grid.png
     :align: center

     Selecting a vertex and moving the vertices to grid

Each change made with the vertex  is stored as a separate entry in the
:guilabel:`Undo` dialog. Remember that all operations support
topological editing when this is turned on.
On-the-fly projection is also supported, and the vertex tool provides
tooltips to identify a vertex by hovering the pointer over it.

.. index:: Vertex editor panel

The Vertex Editor Panel
.......................

When using the :guilabel:`Vertex tool` on a feature, it is possible to
right click to open the :guilabel:`Vertex Editor` panel listing all the
vertices of the feature with their :guilabel:`x`, :guilabel:`y`
(:guilabel:`z`, :guilabel:`m` if applicable) coordinates and
:guilabel:`r` (for the radius, in case of circular geometry).
Simply select a row in the table does select the corresponding vertex
in the map canvas, and vice versa.
Simply change a coordinate in the table and your vertex position is
updated.
You can also select multiple rows and delete them altogether.

.. note:: **Changed behavior in QGIS 3.4**

   Right click on a feature will immediately show the vertex editor and
   lock this feature, thus disabling the editing of any other features.
   While being locked, a feature is exclusive for editing: Selecting
   and moving of vertices and segments by clicking or dragging is only
   possible for this feature.
   New vertices can only be added to the locked feature.
   Also, the vertex editor panel now opens itself automatically upon
   activating the vertex tool, and its position/docked state remembered
   across uses.



.. _figure_edit_vertex:

.. figure:: img/vertex_editor_panel.png
   :align: center

.. _clipboard_feature:

Cutting, Copying and Pasting Features
-------------------------------------

Selected features can be cut, copied and pasted between layers in the same
QGIS project, as long as destination layers are set to |toggleEditing|
:sup:`Toggle editing` beforehand.

.. index:: Polygon to line, Line to polygon

.. _tip_polygon_to_line:

.. tip:: **Transform polygon into line and vice-versa using copy/paste**

   Copy a line feature and paste it in a polygon layer:
   QGIS pastes in the target layer a polygon whose boundary corresponds
   to the closed geometry of the line feature.
   This is a quick way to generate different geometries of the same
   data.

.. index:: CSV, WKT, GeoJSON

Features can also be pasted to external applications as text.
That is, the features are represented in CSV format, with the geometry
data appearing in the OGC Well-Known Text (WKT) format.
WKT and GeoJSON features from outside QGIS can also be pasted to a
layer within QGIS.

When would the copy and paste function come in handy? Well, it turns
out that you can edit more than one layer at a time
and copy/paste features between layers. Why would we want to do this?
Say we need to do some work on a new layer but only need one or two
lakes, not the 5,000 on our ``big_lakes`` layer.
We can create a new layer and use copy/paste to plop the needed lakes
into it.

As an example, we will copy some lakes to a new layer:

#. Load the layer you want to copy from (source layer)
#. Load or create the layer you want to copy to (target layer)
#. Start editing for target layer
#. Make the source layer active by clicking on it in the legend
#. Use the |selectRectangle| :sup:`Select Features by area or single click`
   tool to select the feature(s) on the source layer
#. Click on the |editCopy| :sup:`Copy Features` tool
#. Make the destination layer active by clicking on it in the legend
#. Click on the |editPaste| :sup:`Paste Features` tool
#. Stop editing and save the changes

What happens if the source and target layers have different schemas (field
names and types are not the same)? QGIS populates what matches and ignores
the rest. If you don't care about the attributes being copied to the target
layer, it doesn't matter how you design the fields and data types. If you
want to make sure everything - the feature and its attributes - gets copied,
make sure the schemas match.

.. _tip_projections_and_pasting:

.. note:: **Congruency of Pasted Features**

   If your source and destination layers use the same projection, then the
   pasted features will have geometry identical to the source layer. However,
   if the destination layer is a different projection, then QGIS cannot
   guarantee the geometry is identical. This is simply because there are
   small rounding-off errors involved when converting between projections.

.. _tip_copying_string_attributes:

.. tip:: **Copy string attribute into another**

   If you have created a new column in your attribute table with type
   'string' and want to paste values from another attribute column that
   has a greater length the length of the column size will be extended
   to the same amount.
   This is because the GDAL Shapefile driver starting with GDAL/OGR
   1.10 knows to auto-extend string and integer fields to dynamically
   accommodate for the length of the data to be inserted.

.. _delete_feature:

Deleting Selected Features
--------------------------

If we want to delete an entire feature (attribute and geometry), we can do that
by first selecting the geometry using the regular |selectRectangle| :sup:`Select
Features by area or single click` tool. Selection can also be done from the attribute
table. Once you have the selection set, press :kbd:`Delete` or :kbd:`Backspace`
key or use the |deleteSelectedFeatures| :sup:`Delete Selected` tool to delete
the features. Multiple selected features can be deleted at once.

The |editCut| :sup:`Cut Features` tool on the digitizing toolbar can
also be used to delete features. This effectively deletes the feature but
also places it on a "spatial clipboard". So, we cut the feature to delete.
We could then use the |editPaste| :sup:`Paste Features` tool to put it back,
giving us a one-level undo capability. Cut, copy, and paste work on the
currently selected features, meaning we can operate on more than one at a time.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Undo
   single: Digitizing tools; Redo
.. _undoredo_edits:

Undo and Redo
-------------

The |undo| :sup:`Undo` and |redo| :sup:`Redo` tools allows you to undo or redo
vector editing operations. There is also a dockable widget, which shows all
operations in the undo/redo history (see Figure_edit_undo_). This widget is not
displayed by default; it can be displayed by right-clicking on the toolbar and
activating the :guilabel:`Undo/Redo Panel` checkbox. The Undo/Redo capability
is however active, even if the widget is not displayed.

.. _figure_edit_undo:

.. figure:: img/redo_undo.png
   :align: center

   Redo and Undo digitizing steps

When Undo is hit or :kbd:`Ctrl+Z` (or :kbd:`Cmd+Z`) pressed, the state of all
features and attributes are reverted to
the state before the reverted operation happened. Changes other than normal
vector editing operations (for example, changes done by a plugin) may or may
not be reverted, depending on how the changes were performed.

To use the undo/redo history widget, simply click to select an operation in
the history list. All features will be reverted to the state they were in
after the selected operation.

.. _save_feature_edits:

Saving Edited Layers
--------------------

When a layer is in editing mode, any changes remain in the memory of QGIS.
Therefore, they are not committed/saved immediately to the data source or disk.
If you want to save edits to the current layer but want to continue editing
without leaving the editing mode, you can click the |saveEdits|
:sup:`Save Layer Edits` button. When you turn editing mode off with
|toggleEditing| :sup:`Toggle editing` (or quit QGIS for that matter),
you are also asked if you want to save your changes or discard them.

If the changes cannot be saved (e.g., disk full, or the attributes have values
that are out of range), the QGIS in-memory state is preserved. This allows
you to adjust your edits and try again.

.. _tip_data_integrity:

.. tip:: **Data Integrity**

   It is always a good idea to back up your data source before you start
   editing. While the authors of QGIS have made every effort to preserve the
   integrity of your data, we offer no warranty in this regard.

.. index:: Current edits

Saving multiple layers at once
...............................

This feature allows the digitization of multiple layers. Choose
|fileSaveAs| :guilabel:`Save for Selected Layers` to save all changes you
made in multiple layers. You also have the opportunity to
|rollbackEdits| :guilabel:`Rollback for Selected Layers`, so that the
digitization may be withdrawn for all selected layers.
If you want to stop editing the selected layers, |cancelEdits| :guilabel:`Cancel
for Selected Layer(s)` is an easy way.

The same functions are available for editing all layers of the project.

.. tip:: **Use transaction group to edit, save or rollback multiple layers changes at once**

   When working with layers from the same PostGreSQL database, activate the
   :guilabel:`Automatically create transaction groups where possible` option in
   :menuselection:`Project --> Properties... --> Data Sources` to sync their
   behavior (enter or exit the edit mode, save or rollback changes at the same time).

   single: Digitizing tools; Move feature
   single: Digitizing tools; Move and copy feature
.. _move_feature:

Move Feature(s)
---------------

The |moveFeature| :sup:`Move Feature(s)` tool allows you to move existing features:

#. Select the feature(s) to move.
#. Click on the map canvas to indicate the origin point of the displacement; you
   can rely on snapping capabilities to select an accurate point.

   You can also take advantages of the :ref:`advanced digitizing constraints
   <advanced_digitizing_panel>` to accurately set the origin point coordinates. In
   that case:

   #. First click on the |cad| button to enable the panel.
   #. Type ``x`` and enter the corresponding value for the origin point you'd like
      to use. Then press the |locked| button next to the option to lock the value.
   #. Do the same for the ``y`` coordinate.
   #. Click on the map canvas and your origin point is placed at the indicated
      coordinates.

#. Move over the map canvas to indicate the destination point of the displacement,
   still using snapping mode or, as above, use the advanced digitizing panel which
   would provide complementary ``distance`` and ``angle`` placement constraints
   to place the end point of the translation.
#. Click on the map canvas: the whole features are moved to new location.

Likewise, you can create a translated copy of the feature(s) using the
|moveFeatureCopy| :sup:`Copy and Move Feature(s)` tool.

.. note::

   If no feature is selected when you first click on the map canvas with any of
   the :guilabel:`Move Feature(s)` or :guilabel:`Copy and Move Feature(s)` tools,
   then only the feature under the mouse is affected by the action. So, if you
   want to move several features, they should be selected first.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Rotate Feature
.. _rotate_feature:

Rotate Feature(s)
-----------------

Use the |rotateFeature| :sup:`Rotate Feature(s)` tool to rotate one or multiple
features in the map canvas:

#. Press the |rotateFeature| :sup:`Rotate Feature(s)` icon
#. Then click on the feature to rotate. The feature's centroid is referenced as
   rotation center, a preview of the rotated feature is displayed and a widget
   opens showing the current :guilabel:`Rotation` angle.
#. Click on the map canvas when you are satisfied with the new placement or
   manually enter the rotation angle in the text box. You can also use the
   :guilabel:`Snap to Â°` box to constrain the rotation values.
#. If you want to rotate several features at once, they shall be selected first,
   and the rotation is by default around the centroid of their combined
   geometries.

You can also use an anchor point different from the default feature centroid:
press the :kbd:`Ctrl` button, click on the map canvas and that point will be
used as the new rotation center.

If you hold :kbd:`Shift` before clicking on the map, the rotation will be done
in 45 degree steps, which can be modified afterwards in the user input widget.

To abort feature rotation, press the :kbd:`ESC` button or click on the
|rotateFeature| :sup:`Rotate Feature(s)` icon.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Simplify Feature
.. _simplify_feature:

Simplify Feature
----------------

The |simplifyFeatures| :sup:`Simplify Feature` tool allows you to interactively
reshape a line or polygon geometry by reducing or densifying the number of
vertices, as long as the geometry remains valid:

#. Select the |simplifyFeatures| :sup:`Simplify Feature` tool.
#. Click on the feature or drag a rectangle over the features.
#. A dialog pops up allowing you to define the :guilabel:`Method` to apply, ie
   whether you would like to:

   * :ref:`simplify the geometry <qgissimplifygeometries>`, meaning less vertices
     than the original. Available methods are ``Simplify by distance``, ``Simplify
     by snapping to grid`` or ``simplify by area (Visvalingam)``. You'd then need
     to indicate the value of :guilabel:`Tolerance` in ``Layer units``, ``Pixels``
     or ``map units`` to use for simplification. The higher the tolerance is the
     more vertices can be deleted.

     .. TODO: it could be nice to have slight details on these methods and
        what the tolerance actually represents...

   * or :ref:`densify the geometries <qgissmoothgeometry>` with new vertices
     thanks to the ``Smooth`` option: for each existing vertex, two vertices are
     placed on each of the segments originated from it, at an :guilabel:`Offset`
     distance representing the percentage of the segment length.
     You can also set the number of :guilabel:`Iterations` the placement would
     be processed: the more iterations, the more vertices and smoother is the
     feature.

   Settings that you used will be saved when leaving a project or an edit
   session. So you can go back to the same parameters the next time you
   simplify a feature.
#. A summary of the modifications that would apply is shown at the bottom of the
   dialog, listing number of features and number of vertices (before and after
   the operation and the ratio the change represents).
   Also, in the map canvas, the expected geometry is displayed over the existing
   one, using the rubberband color.
#. When the expected geometry fits your needs, click :guilabel:`OK` to apply the
   modification.
   Otherwise, to abort the operation, you can either press :guilabel:`Cancel` or
   right-click in the map canvas.

.. note:: Unlike the feature simplification option in :menuselection:`Settings -->
   Options --> Rendering` menu which simplifies the geometry just for rendering,
   the |simplifyFeatures| :sup:`Simplify Feature` tool permanently modifies
   feature's geometry in data source.


.. index:: Geometryless feature, Multipoint, Multiline, Multipolygon
   single: Digitizing tools; Add Part
.. _add_part:

Add Part
--------

You can |addPart| :sup:`Add Part` to a selected feature generating a
multipoint, multiline or multipolygon feature. The new part must be digitized
outside the existing one which should be selected beforehand.

The |addPart| :sup:`Add Part` can also be used to add a geometry to a geometryless
feature. First, select the feature in the attribute table and digitize the new
geometry with the |addPart| :sup:`Add Part` tool.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Delete Part
.. _delete_part:

Delete Part
-----------

The |deletePart| :sup:`Delete Part` tool allows you to delete parts from
multifeatures (e.g., to delete polygons from a multi-polygon feature). This
tool works with all multi-part geometries: point, line and polygon. Furthermore,
it can be used to totally remove the geometric component of a feature.
To delete a part, simply click within the target part.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Add Ring
.. _add_ring:

Add Ring
--------

You can create ring polygons using the |addRing|
:sup:`Add Ring` icon in the toolbar. This means that inside an existing area, it
is possible to digitize further polygons that will occur as a 'hole', so
only the area between the boundaries of the outer and inner polygons remains
as a ring polygon.

.. FixMe: I think this tool should behave as below
.. Like many digitizing tools, the |addRing| :sup:`Add Ring` tool adds ring to all
.. selected features if any, otherwise all overlapping features are pierced.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Fill Ring
.. _fill_ring:

Fill Ring
---------

The |fillRing| :sup:`Fill Ring` tool helps you create polygon feature that
totally falls within another one without any overlapping area; that is the new
feature covers a hole within the existing one. To create such a feature:

#. Select the |fillRing| :sup:`Fill Ring` tool.
#. Draw a new polygon over the existing feature: QGIS adds a ring to its geometry
   (like if you used the |addRing| :sup:`Add Ring` tool) and creates a new
   feature whose geometry matches the ring (like if you :ref:`traced <tracing>`
   over the interior boundaries with the |capturePolygon| :sup:`Add polygon
   feature` tool).
#. Or alternatively, if the ring already exists on the feature, place the mouse
   over the ring and left-click while pressing :kbd:`Shift`: a new feature
   filling the hole is drawn at that place.

   The :guilabel:`Feature Attributes` form of the new feature opens, pre-filled
   with values of the "parent" feature and/or :ref:`fields constraints
   <configure_field>`.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Delete Ring
.. _delete_ring:

Delete Ring
-----------

The |deleteRing| :sup:`Delete Ring` tool allows you to delete rings within
an existing polygon, by clicking inside the hole. This tool only works with
polygon and multi-polygon features. It doesn't
change anything when it is used on the outer ring of the polygon.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Reshape Feature
   single: Digitizing tools; Extend lines
.. _reshape_feature:

Reshape Features
----------------

You can reshape line and polygon features using the |reshape|
:sup:`Reshape Features` tool on the toolbar. For lines, it replaces the line
part from the first to the last intersection with the original line.

.. _figure_reshape_line:

.. figure:: img/reshape_lines.png
   :align: center

   Reshape line

.. tip:: **Extend linestring geometries with reshape tool**

  Use the |reshape| :sup:`Reshape Features` tool to extend existing linestring
  geometries: snap to the first or last vertex of the line and draw a new one.
  Validate and the feature's geometry becomes the combination of the two lines.

For polygons, it will reshape the polygon's boundary. For it to work, the
reshape tool's line must cross the polygon's boundary at least twice. To draw
the line, click on the map canvas to add vertexes. To finish it, just
right-click. Like with the lines, only the segment between the first and the
last intersections is considered. The reshape line's segments that are inside
the polygon will result in cropping it, where the ones outside the polygon will
extend it.

.. _figure_reshape_polygon:

.. figure:: img/reshape_polygon.png
   :align: center

   Reshape polygon

With polygons, reshaping can sometimes lead to unintended results.
It is mainly useful to replace smaller parts of a polygon, not for
major overhauls, and the reshape line is not allowed to cross several
polygon rings, as this would generate an invalid polygon.

.. note::
   The reshape tool may alter the starting position of a polygon ring or a
   closed line. So, the point that is represented 'twice' will not be the same
   any more. This may not be a problem for most applications, but it is
   something to consider.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Offset Curves
.. _offset_curve:

Offset Curves
-------------

The |offsetCurve| :sup:`Offset Curve` tool creates parallel shifts of
line layers.
The tool can be applied to the edited layer (the geometries are modified)
or also to background layers (in which case it creates copies of the lines /
rings and adds them to the edited layer).
It is thus ideally suited for the creation of distance line layers.
The :guilabel:`User Input` dialog pops-up, showing the displacement distance.

To create a shift of a line layer, you must first go into editing mode
and activate the |offsetCurve| :sup:`Offset Curve` tool.
Then click on a feature to shift it.
Move the mouse and click where wanted or enter the desired distance in
the user input widget.
Your changes may then be saved with the |saveEdits|
:sup:`Save Layer Edits` tool.


QGIS options dialog (Digitizing tab then **Curve offset tools** section) allows
you to configure some parameters like **Join style**, **Quadrant segments**,
**Miter limit**.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Reverse Line
.. _reverse_line:

Reverse Line
------------
Changing the direction of a line geometry can be useful for
cartographical purposes or when preparing for network analysis.

To change a line direction:

#. Activate the reverse line tool by clicking |reverseLine|
   :sup:`Reverse line`.
#. Click on the line. The direction of the line
   is reversed.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Split Features
.. _split_feature:

Split Features
--------------

Use the |splitFeatures| :sup:`Split Features` tool to split a feature into two
or more new and independent features, ie. each geometry corresponding to a new
row in the attribute table.

To split line or polygon features:

#. Select the |splitFeatures| :sup:`Split Features` tool.
#. Draw a line across the feature(s) you want to split.
   If a selection is active, only selected features are split. When set,
   :ref:`default values or clauses <configure_field>` are applied to corresponding
   fields and other attributes of the parent feature are by default copied to the
   new features.
#. You can then as usually modify any of the attributes of any resulting feature.

.. tip:: **Split a polyline into new features in one-click**

   Using the |splitFeatures| :sup:`Split Features` tool, snap and click on an
   existing vertex of a polyline feature to split that feature into two new
   features.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Split Parts
.. _split_part:

Split parts
-----------

In QGIS it is possible to split the parts of a multi part feature so that the
number of parts is increased. Just draw a line across the part you want to split using
the |splitParts| :sup:`Split Parts` icon.

.. tip:: **Split a polyline into new parts in one-click**

   Using the |splitParts| :sup:`Split Parts` tool, snap and click on an
   existing vertex of a polyline feature to split the feature into two new
   polylines belonging to the same feature.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Merge Selected Features

.. _mergeselectedfeatures:

Merge selected features
-----------------------

The |mergeFeatures| :sup:`Merge Selected Features` tool allows you to create
a new feature by merging existing ones: their geometries are merged to generate
a new one. If features don't have common boundaries,
a multipolygon/multipolyline/multipoint feature is created.

#. First, select the features you'd like to combine.
#. Then press the |mergeFeatures| :sup:`Merge Selected Features` button.
#. In the new dialog, the :guilabel:`Merge` line at the bottom of the table
   shows the attributes of the resulting feature. You can alter any of these
   values either by:

   * manually replacing the value in the corresponding cell;
   * selecting a row in the table and pressing :guilabel:`Take attributes from
     selected feature` to use the values of this initial feature;
   * pressing :guilabel:`Skip all fields` to use empty attributes;
   * or, expanding the drop down menu at the top of the table, select any of the
     above options to apply to the corresponding field only. There, you can also
     choose to aggregate the initial features attributes (Minimum, Maximum, Median,
     Sum, Count, Concatenation... depending on the type of the field.
     see :ref:`statistical_summary` for the full list of functions).

   .. note::
    If the layer has default values or clauses present on fields,
    these are used as the initial value for the merged feature.

#. Press :guilabel:`OK` to apply the modifications. A single (multi)feature is
   created in the layer, replacing the previously selected ones.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Merge Attributes
.. _mergeattributesfeatures:

Merge attributes of selected features
-------------------------------------

The |mergeFeatAttributes| :sup:`Merge Attributes of Selected Features` tool
allows you to apply same attributes to features without merging their boundaries.
The dialog is the same as the ``Merge Selected Features`` tool's except that
unlike that tool, selected objects are kept with their geometry while some of their
attributes are made identical.


.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Rotate Point Symbols
.. _rotate_symbol:

Rotate Point Symbols
--------------------

The |rotatePointSymbols| :sup:`Rotate Point Symbols` allows you to change the
rotation of point symbols in the map canvas.

#. First of all, apply to the symbol a :ref:`data-defined <data_defined>`
   rotation:

   #. In the :menuselection:`Layer Properties --> Symbology` dialog, browse to
      the symbol editor dialog.
   #. Click the |dataDefined| :guilabel:`Data-defined override` widget near the
      :guilabel:`Rotation` option of the top :guilabel:`Marker` level (preferably)
      of the symbol layers.
   #. Choose a field in the :guilabel:`Field Type` combobox. Values of this
      field are hence used to rotate each feature's symbol accordingly.

   .. note:: **Make sure that the same field is assigned to all the symbol layers**

    Setting the data-defined rotation field at the topmost level of the symbol
    tree automatically propagates it to all the symbol layers, a prerequisite to
    perform graphical symbol rotation with the :guilabel:`Rotate Point Symbols`
    tool. Indeed, if a symbol layer does not have the same field attached to its
    rotation property, the tool will not work.

   .. _figure_rotate_point:

   .. figure:: img/rotatepointsymbol.png
      :align: center

      Rotating a point symbol

#. Then click on a point feature in the map canvas with the
   |rotatePointSymbols| :sup:`Rotate Point Symbols` and move the mouse
   around, holding the left button pressed.
   A red arrow with the rotation value will be visualized (see
   Figure_rotate_point_).
#. Release the left mouse button again, the symbol is defined with
   this new rotation and the rotation field is updated in the layer's
   attribute table.

.. tip::
   If you hold the :kbd:`Ctrl` key pressed, the rotation will be done in 15
   degree steps.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Offset Point Symbols
.. _offset_symbol:

Offset Point Symbols
--------------------

The |offsetPointSymbols| :sup:`Offset Point Symbols` allows you to interactively
change the rendered position of point symbols in the map canvas. This tool behaves
like the |rotatePointSymbols| :sup:`Rotate Point Symbols` tool except that it
requires you to connect a field to the data-defined :guilabel:`Offset (X,Y)`
property of the symbol, field which will then be populated with the offset
coordinates while moving the symbol in the map canvas.

.. note:: The |offsetPointSymbols| :sup:`Offset Point Symbols` tool doesn't
   move the point feature itself; you should use the |vertexToolActiveLayer|
   :sup:`Vertex Tool (Current Layer)` or |moveFeaturePoint| :sup:`Move Feature`
   tool for this purpose.

.. _trim_extend_feature:

Trim/Extend Feature
-------------------

When a digitized line is too short or too long to snap to another line (missing or
crossing the line), it is necessary to be able to extend or shorten the segment.

The |trimExtend| :sup:`Trim/Extend` tool allows you to also modify
(multi)lines AND (multi)polygons.
Moreover, it is not necessarily the end of the lines that is
concerned; any segment of a geometry can be modified.

.. note:: This can lead to invalid geometries.

.. note:: You must activate segment snapping for this tool to work.

The tool asks you to select a limit (a segment) with respect to which
another segment will be extended or trimmed.
Unlike the vertex tool, a check is performed to modify only the layer
being edited.

When both segments are in 3D, the tool performs an interpolation on
the limit segment to get the Z value.

In the case of a trim, you must select the part that will be shortened
by clicking on it.

.. _shape_edit:

Shape digitizing
================

The :guilabel:`Shape Digitizing` toolbar offers a set of tools to draw
regular shapes and curved geometries.

.. index:: Circular string
.. _add_circular_string:

Add Circular string
-------------------

The |circularStringCurvePoint| :sup:`Add circular string` or
|circularStringRadius| :sup:`Add circular string by radius` buttons allow users
to add line or polygon features with a circular geometry.

Creating features with these tools follow the same rule as of other digitizing
tools: left-click to place vertices and right-click to finish the geometry.
While drawing the geometry, you can switch from one tool to the other as well
as to the :ref:`linear geometry tools <add_feature>`, creating some coumpound
geometries.

.. note:: **Curved geometries are stored as such only in compatible data provider**

   Although QGIS allows to digitize curved geometries within any editable
   data format, you need to be using a data provider (e.g. PostGIS, memory
   layer, GML or WFS) that supports curves to have features stored as
   curved, otherwise QGIS segmentizes the circular arcs.

.. index:: Draw circle
.. _draw_circles:

Draw Circles
------------

There is a set of tools for drawing circles. The tools are described
below.

Circles are converted into circular strings. Therefore, as explained in
:ref:`add_circular_string`, if allowed by the data provider, it will be saved as a
curved geometry, if not, QGIS will segmentize the circular arcs.

- |circle2Points| :sup:`Add circle from 2 points`: The two points define the diameter
  and the orientation of  the circle. (Left-click, right-click)
- |circle3Points| :sup:`Add circle from 3 points`: Draws a circle from three
  known points on the circle. (Left-click, left-click, right-click)
- |circleCenterPoint| :sup:`Add circle from center and a point`: Draws a circle
  with a given center and a point on the circle (Left-click, right-click).
  When used with the :ref:`advanced_digitizing_panel` this tool can become a
  "Add circle from center and radius" tool by setting and locking the distance
  value after first click.
- |circle3Tangents| :sup:`Add circle from 3 tangents`: Draws a circle that is
  tangential to three segments. **Note that you must activate snapping to
  segments** (See :ref:`snapping_tolerance`). Click on a segment to add a
  tangent. If two tangents are parallel, an error message appears and the input
  is cleared. (Left-click, left-click, right-click)
- |circle2TangentsPoint| :sup:`Add circle from 2 tangents and a point`: Similar
  to circle from 3 tangents, except that you have to select two tangents, enter
  a radius and select the desired center.

.. index::
   single: Digitizing tools; Advanced panel
.. _advanced_digitizing_panel:

The Advanced Digitizing panel
=============================

When capturing, reshaping, splitting new or existing geometries you also have the
possibility to use the Advanced Digitizing panel. You can digitize lines exactly
parallel or perpendicular to a particular angle or lock lines to specific angles.
Furthermore, you can enter coordinates directly so that you can make a precise
definition of your new geometry.

.. _figure_advanced_digitizing:

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing.png

   The Advanced Digitizing panel

The :guilabel:`Advanced Digitizing` panel can be open either with a right-click
on the toolbar, from :menuselection:`View --> Panels -->` menu or pressing
:kbd:`Ctrl+4`. Once the panel is visible, click the |cad| :sup:`Enable advanced
digitizing tools` button to activate the set of tools.

.. note:: The tools are not enabled if the map view is in geographic coordinates.

Concepts
--------

The aim of the Advanced Digitizing tool is to lock coordinates, lengths, and angles
when moving the mouse during the digitalizing in the map canvas.

You can also create constraints with relative or absolute reference. Relative
reference means that the next vertex constraints' values will be relative to the
previous vertex or segment.

Snapping Settings
-----------------

Click the |settings| button to set the Advanced Digitizing Tool snapping settings.
You can make the tool snap to common angles. The options are:

- :guilabel:`Do not snap to common angles`
- :guilabel:`Snap to 30Âº angles`
- :guilabel:`Snap to 45Âº angles`
- :guilabel:`Snap to 90Âº angles`

You can also control the snapping to features. The options are:

- :guilabel:`Do not snap to vertices or segments`
- :guilabel:`Snap according to project configuration`
- :guilabel:`Snap to all layers`

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

To speed up the use of Advanced Digitizing Panel, there are a couple of keyboard
shortcuts available:

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Absolute reference digitizing
-----------------------------

When drawing a new geometry from scratch, it is very useful to have the
possibility to start digitizing vertexes at given coordinates.

For example, to add a new feature to a polygonal layer, click the
|capturePolygon| button. You can choose the X and Y coordinates where you want
to start editing the feature, then:

- Click the :guilabel:`x` text box (or use the :kbd:`X` keyboard shortcut).
- Type the X coordinate value you want and press :kbd:`Enter` or click the
  |locked| button to their right to lock the mouse to the X axis on the map
  canvas.
- Click the :guilabel:`y` text box (or use the :kbd:`Y` keyboard shortcut).
- Type the Y coordinate value you want and press :kbd:`Enter` or click the
  |locked| button to their right to lock the mouse to the Y axis on the map
  canvas.

Two blue dotted lines and a green cross identify the exact coordinates you
entered. Start digitizing by clicking on the map canvas; the mouse position is
locked at the green cross.

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_coordinates.png
   :align: center

   Start drawing at given coordinates

You can continue digitizing by free hand, adding a new pair of coordinates, or
you can type the segment's **length** (distance) and **angle**.

If you want to draw a segment of a given length, click the :guilabel:`d
(distance)` text box (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`D`), type the distance value (in
map units) and press :kbd:`Enter` or click the |locked| button on the right to
lock the mouse in the map canvas to the length of the segment.
In the map canvas, the clicked point is surrounded by a circle whose radius is
the value entered in the distance text box.

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_distance.png
   :align: center

   Fixed length segment

Finally, you can also choose the angle of the segment. As described before ,
click the :guilabel:`a (angle)` text box (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`A`), type the
angle value (in degrees), and press :kbd:`Enter` or click the |locked| buttons
on the right to lock it. In this way the segment will follow the desired angle:

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_angle.png
   :align: center

   Fixed angle segment

Relative reference digitizing
-----------------------------

Instead of using absolute values of angles or coordinates, you can also use
values relative to the last digitized vertex or segment.

For angles, you can click the |delta| button on the left of the :guilabel:`a`
text box (or press :kbd:`Shift+A`) to toggle relative angles to the previous
segment. With that option on, angles are measured between the last segment
and the mouse pointer.

For coordinates, click the |delta| buttons to the left of the :guilabel:`x` or
:guilabel:`y` text boxes (or press :kbd:`Shift+X` or :kbd:`Shift+Y`) to
toggle relative coordinates to the previous vertex. With these options on,
coordinates measurement will consider the last vertex to be the X and Y axes
origin.

Continuous lock
---------------

Both in absolute or relative reference digitizing, angle, distance, X and Y
constraints can be locked continuously by clicking the |lockedRepeat|
:guilabel:`Continuous lock` buttons. Using continuous lock allows you to
digitize several points or vertexes using the same constraints.


Parallel and perpendicular lines
--------------------------------

All the tools described above can be combined with the |cadPerpendicular|
:sup:`Perpendicular` and |cadParallel| :sup:`Parallel` tools. These two tools
allow drawing segments perfectly perpendicular or parallel to another segment.

To draw a *perpendicular* segment, during the editing click the
|cadPerpendicular| :sup:`Perpendicular` icon (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`P`) to
activate it. Before drawing the perpendicular line,
click on the segment of an existing feature that you want to be perpendicular
to (the line of the existing feature will be colored in light orange); you
should see a blue dotted line where your feature will be snapped:

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_perpendicular.png
   :align: center

   Perpendicular digitizing

To draw a *parallel* feature, the steps are the same: click on the
|cadParallel| :sup:`Parallel` icon (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`P` twice), click on
the segment you want to use as reference and start drawing your feature:

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_parallel.png
   :align: center

   Parallel digitizing

These two tools just find the right angle of the perpendicular and
parallel angle and lock this parameter during your editing.

Construction mode
-----------------

You can enable and disable *construction* mode by clicking on the
|cadConstruction| :sup:`Construction` icon or with the :kbd:`C` keyboard
shortcut. While in construction mode, clicking the map canvas won't add new
vertexes, but will capture the clicks' positions so that you can use them as
reference points to then lock distance, angle or X and Y relative values.

As an example, the construction mode can be used to draw some point
at an exact distance from an existing point.

With an existing point in the map canvas and the snapping mode correctly
activated, you can easily draw other points at given distances and angles from
it. In addition to the |cad| button, you have to activate also the
*construction* mode by clicking the |cadConstruction| :sup:`Construction`
icon or with the :kbd:`C` keyboard shortcut.

Click next to the point from which you want to calculate the distance and click
on the :guilabel:`d` box (:kbd:`D` shortcut) type the desired distance and press
:kbd:`Enter` to lock the mouse position in the map canvas:

.. figure:: img/advanced_digitizing_distance_point.png
   :align: center

   Distance from point

Before adding the new point, press :kbd:`C` to exit the construction mode.
Now, you can click on the map canvas, and the point will be placed at
the distance entered.

You can also use the angle constraint to, for example, create another point at
the same distance of the original one, but at a particular angle from the newly
added point. Click the |cadConstruction| :sup:`Construction` icon or with the
:kbd:`C` keyboard shortcut to enter construction mode. Click the recently added
point, and then the other one to set a direction segment. Then, click on the
:guilabel:`d` text box (:kbd:`D` shortcut) type the desired distance and press
:kbd:`Enter`. Click the :guilabel:`a` text box (:kbd:`A` shortcut) type the
angle you want and press :kbd:`Enter`. The mouse position will be locked both in
distance and angle.

   :align: center

   Distance and angle from points

Before adding the new point, press :kbd:`C` to exit the construction mode. Now,
you can click on the map canvas, and the point will be placed at the distance
and angle entered. Repeating the process, several points can be added.

The Processing in-place layer modifier
======================================

The :ref:`Processing menu <label_processing>` provides access to a large set of
tools to analyze and create new features based on the properties of the input
features or their relations with other features (within the same layer or not).
While the common behavior is to create new layers as outputs, some algorithms
also allow modifications to the input layer. This is a handy way to automate
multiple features modification using advanced and complex operations.

To edit features in-place:

#. Select the layer to edit in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel.
#. Select the concerned features. You can skip this step, in which case the
   modification will apply to the whole layer.
#. Press the |processSelected| :sup:`Edit Features In-Place` button at the top
   of the :ref:`Processing toolbox <processing.toolbox>`. The list of algorithms
   is filtered, showing only those compatible with in-place modifications, i.e.:

   * They work at the feature source and not at the layer level.
   * They do not change the layer structure, e.g. adding or removing fields.
   * They do not change the geometry type, e.g. from line to point layer.

   .. figure:: img/edit_inplace_algorithms.png
      :align: center

      Processing algorithms: all (left) vs polygon in-place editors (right)

#. Find the algorithm you'd like to run and double-click it.

   .. note:: If the algorithm does not need any additional user-set parameters
    (excluding the usual input and output layer parameters), then the algorithm
    is run immediately without any dialog popup.

   #. If parameters other than the usual input or output layers are needed,
      the algorithm dialog pops up. Fill in the required information.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Modify Selected Features` or :guilabel:`Modify All Features`
      depending on whether there's an active selection.

   Changes are applied to the layer and placed in the edit buffer: the layer
   is indeed toggled to editing mode with unsaved modification as indicated by
   the |editableEdits| icon next to the layer name.
#. As usual, press |saveEdits| :sup:`Save layer edits` to commit the changes in
   the layer. You can also press |undo| :sup:`Undo` to rollback the whole
   modification.
