Installation on Debian-based systems
====================================

.. index:: Debian, Ubuntu

We will give a short and simple installation how-to for
a minimal working configuration on Debian based systems (including Ubuntu and derivatives). However, many other
distributions and OSs provide packages for QGIS Server.

Requirements and steps to add official QGIS repositories to install current QGIS Server on a Debian based system are
provided in `QGIS installers page <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html>`_.

.. note:: In Ubuntu you can use your regular user, prepending ``sudo`` to
  commands requiring admin permissions. In Debian you can work as admin (``root``),
  without using ``sudo``.

We strongly suggest installing the LTR version.

Once the chosen repository is configured, installation is simply done with:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install qgis-server
 # if you want to install server plugins, also:
 apt install python-qgis

You can test the installation by running:

::

 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
 
If you get the following output, the server is correctly installed::

 QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
 Warning 1: Unable to find driver ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.
 Warning 1: Unable to find driver ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.
 Warning 1: Unable to find driver JP2ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.
 Warning 1: Unable to find driver ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.

 <ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0" xmlns="https://www.opengis.net/ogc">
  <ServiceException code="Service configuration error">Service unknown or unsupported</ServiceException>
 </ServiceExceptionReport>

Let's add a sample project. You can use your own, or one from
`Training demo data <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Training-Data/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

 mkdir /home/qgis/projects/
 cd /home/qgis/projects/
 wget https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Training-Data/archive/v2.0.zip
 unzip v2.0.zip
 mv QGIS-Training-Data-2.0/exercise_data/qgis-server-tutorial-data/world.qgs .
 mv QGIS-Training-Data-2.0/exercise_data/qgis-server-tutorial-data/naturalearth.sqlite .

Of course, you can use your favorite GIS software to open this file and
take a look on the configuration and available layers.

.. _`httpserver`:

HTTP Server configuration
-------------------------

To run QGIS server you need a web server. Recommended choices are **Apache** or **Nginx**.

.. note:: In the following, please replace ``localhost`` with the name or IP address of your server.

.. index:: Apache, mod_fcgid

Apache
......

Install Apache and  `mod_fcgid <https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-fcgid
 a2enmod cgi

QGIS Server is now available at http://localhost/. To check, type in a browser:

::

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

If you get something like:

.. code-block:: xml

 <WMS_Capabilities version="1.3.0" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wms http://schemas.opengis.net/wms/1.3.0/capabilities_1_3_0.xsd http://www.opengis.net/sld http://schemas.opengis.net/sld/1.1.0/sld_capabilities.xsd http://www.qgis.org/wms http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetSchemaExtension">
 ...

the server is correctly installed and responds through Apache.

Let's now add ``mod_fcgid`` configuration directives for QGIS Server:

.. code-block:: apacheconf

    # Tell QGIS Server instances to use a specific display number for xvfb
    # necessary for printing, see below
    FcgidInitialEnv DISPLAY ":99"
    # Activate QGIS log (different from apache logs)
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /var/log/qgis/qgisserver.log
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL "0"
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_STDERR "1"
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_DEBUG 1
    # Add a default QGIS project
    SetEnv QGIS_PROJECT_FILE /home/qgis/projects/world.qgs
    # QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH must lead to a directory writeable by www-data
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH "/var/www/qgis-server/qgisserverdb/"
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE "/var/www/qgis-server/qgisserverdb/qgis-auth.db"
    
    <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
    # Longer timeout for WPS... default = 40
    FcgidIOTimeout 120
    FcgidMaxRequestLen 26214400
    FcgidConnectTimeout 60
    </IfModule>

.. note::

  See the ``mod_fcgid`` documentation for more information on the ``Fcgid`` parameters
  used. And see below (``xvfb``) to understand when and why the ``DISPLAY`` environment variable
  needs to be set.

These directives can be added either to :file:`/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf`
for a system-wide configuration, or to a specific Apache ``VirtualHost``,
if you want QGIS server to be available only for that address; the default one
is available at :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`.

.. code-block:: apache

    <Location /qgisserver>
     SetHandler fcgid-script
     FcgidWrapper /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi virtual
     Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
     Require all granted
    </Location>

Then create all the needed directories with appropriate permissions:

.. code-block:: bash

 mkdir -p /var/log/qgis/
 chown www-data:www-data /var/log/qgis
 mkdir -p /var/www/qgis-server/qgisserverdb/
 chown www-data:www-data /var/www/qgis-server/qgisserverdb/

Now restart Apache for the new configuration to be taken into account:

.. code-block:: bash

 systemctl restart apache2 

QGIS Server is now available at http://localhost/qgisserver. To check, type in a browser, as in the simple case:

::

 http://localhost/qgisserver/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

.. index:: nginx, spawn-fcgi, fcgiwrap

NGINX
.....

You can also use QGIS Server with `NGINX <https://nginx.org/>`_. Unlike Apache,
NGINX does not automatically spawn FastCGI processes. The FastCGI processes are
to be started by something else.

On Debian-based systems, you can use **spawn-fcgi** or **fcgiwrap** to start
and manage the QGIS Server processes. Official Debian packages exist for both.

.. warning::

    **fcgiwrap** is easier to set up than **spawn-fcgi**, because it's already wrapped
    in a Systemd service. But it also leads to a solution that is much slower
    than using spawn-fcgi. With fcgiwrap a new QGIS Server process is created
    on each request, meaning that the QGIS Server initialization process, which
    includes reading and parsing the QGIS project file, is done on each request.
    With spawn-fcgi, the QGIS Server process remains alive between requests,
    resulting in much better performance. For that reason, spawn-fcgi
    is recommended for production use.

Another option is to rely on **Systemd**, the init system for GNU/Linux that most
Linux distributions use today.
One of the advantages of this method is that it requires no other components or
processes.
Itâ€™s meant to be simple, yet robust and efficient for production deployments.

Install NGINX:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install nginx

spawn-fcgi
^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use `spawn-fcgi <https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi/wiki>`_,
the first step is to install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt install spawn-fcgi


Then, introduce the following block in your NGINX server configuration:

.. code-block:: nginx

     location /qgisserver {
         gzip           off;
         include        fastcgi_params;
         fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/qgisserver.socket;
     }

And restart NGINX to take into account the new configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

 service nginx restart

Finally, considering that there is no default service file for spawn-fcgi, you
have to manually start QGIS Server in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

 spawn-fcgi -s /var/run/qgisserver.socket \
                 -U www-data -G www-data -n \
                 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

**todo**: Add instructions to add a ``spawn-fcgi.service``

QGIS Server is now available at http://localhost/qgisserver.

.. note::

    With the above command spawn-fcgi spawns only one QGIS Server process. To use more than one QGIS
    Server process you can combine spawn-fcgi with the
    `multiwatch <https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/multiwatch/wiki>`_ tool, which is also
    packaged in Debian.

Of course, you can add an init script (like a ``qgis-server.service`` file
with systemd) to start QGIS Server at boot time or whenever you want.

**todo**: Add instructions to add a ``qgis-server.service``

fcgiwrap
^^^^^^^^

Using `fcgiwrap <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/fcgiwrap/>`_
is much easier to setup than **spawn-fcgi** but it's much slower.
You first have to install the corresponding package:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install fcgiwrap

Then, introduce the following block in your NGINX server configuration:

.. code-block:: nginx
   :linenos:

     location /qgisserver {
         gzip           off;
         include        fastcgi_params;
         fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
         fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi;
     }

Finally, restart NGINX and **fcgiwrap** to take into account the new configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

 service nginx restart
 service fcgiwrap restart

QGIS Server is now available at http://localhost/qgisserver.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **include fastcgi_params;** used in previous configuration is important
as it adds the parameters from :file:`/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params`:

.. code-block:: nginx

 fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
 fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
 fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;

 fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
 fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
 fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_SCHEME     $scheme;
 fastcgi_param  HTTPS              $https if_not_empty;

 fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;

 fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
 fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;

 # PHP only, required if PHP was built with --enable-force-cgi-redirect
 fastcgi_param  REDIRECT_STATUS    200;

Of course, you may override these variables in your own configuration. For
example:

.. code-block:: nginx

    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME domain.name.eu;

Moreover, you can use some :ref:`qgis-server-envvar` to configure QGIS Server.
With NGINX as HTTP Server, you have to use ``fastcgi_param`` to define these
variables as shown below:

.. code-block:: nginx

    fastcgi_param  QGIS_DEBUG              1;
    fastcgi_param  QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE    /var/log/qgis/qgisserver.log;
    fastcgi_param  QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL   0;

.. note::

    When using spawn-fcgi, you may directly define environment variables
    before running the server. For example:
    ``export QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE=/var/log/qgis/qgisserver.log``

Systemd
^^^^^^^

This method to deploy QGIS Server relies on two Systemd units:

* a `Socket unit <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html>`_
* and a `Service unit <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html>`_.

The **QGIS Server Socket unit** defines and creates a file system socket,
used by NGINX to start and communicate with QGIS Server.
The Socket unit has to be configured with ``Accept=false``, meaning that the
calls to the ``accept()`` system call are delegated to the process created by
the Service unit.
It is located in :file:`/etc/systemd/system/qgis-server@.socket`, which is actually
a template:

.. code-block:: ini

 [Unit]
 Description=QGIS Server Listen Socket (instance %i)
 
 [Socket]
 Accept=false
 ListenStream=/var/run/qgis-server-%i.sock
 SocketUser=www-data
 SocketGroup=www-data
 SocketMode=0600
 
 [Install]
 WantedBy=sockets.target

Now enable and start sockets:

.. code-block:: bash

 systemctl enable qgis-server@1.socket
 systemctl start qgis-server@1.socket
 systemctl enable qgis-server@2.socket
 systemctl start qgis-server@2.socket
 systemctl enable qgis-server@3.socket
 systemctl start qgis-server@3.socket
 systemctl enable qgis-server@4.socket
 systemctl start qgis-server@4.socket

The **QGIS Server Service unit** defines and starts the QGIS Server process.
The important part is that the Service processâ€™ standard input is connected to
the socket defined by the Socket unit.
This has to be configured using ``StandardInput=socket`` in the Service unit
configuration located in :file:`/etc/systemd/system/qgis-server@.service`:

.. code-block:: ini

 [Unit]
 Description=QGIS Server Service (instance %i)
 
 [Service]
 User=www-data
 Group=www-data
 StandardOutput=null
 StandardError=journal
 StandardInput=socket
 ExecStart=/usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
 EnvironmentFile=/etc/qgis-server/env
 
 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target

Now start socket service:

.. code-block:: bash

 sudo systemctl start qgis-server@sockets.service

Note that the QGIS Server :ref:`environment variables <qgis-server-envvar>`
are defined in a separate file, :file:`/etc/qgis-server/env`.
It could look like this:

.. code-block:: make

 QGIS_PROJECT_FILE=/etc/qgis/myproject.qgs
 QGIS_SERVER_LOG_STDERR=1
 QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL=3

Finally, introduce the NGINX configuration for this setup:

.. code-block:: nginx

 upstream qgis-server_backend {
    server unix:/var/run/qgis-server-1.sock;
    server unix:/var/run/qgis-server-2.sock;
    server unix:/var/run/qgis-server-3.sock;
    server unix:/var/run/qgis-server-4.sock;
 }
 
 server {
    â€¦
 
    location /qgis {
        gzip off;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass qgis-server_backend;
    }
 }

Now restart NGINX for the new configuration to be taken into account:

.. code-block:: bash

 service nginx restart

Thanks to Oslandia for sharing `their tutorial <https://oslandia.com/en/2018/11/23/deploying-qgis-server-with-systemd/>`_. 

Xvfb
----

QGIS Server needs a running X Server to be fully usable, in particular for printing. 
On servers it is usually recommended not to install it, so you may use ``xvfb``
to have a virtual X environment.

To install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install xvfb

Then, according to your HTTP server, you should configure the **DISPLAY**
parameter or directly use **xvfb-run**.

With Apache you just add to your ``Fcgi`` configuration (see above):

.. code-block:: apache

 FcgidInitialEnv DISPLAY       ":99"

Create the service file:

.. code-block:: bash

  sh -c \
  "echo \
  '[Unit]
  Description=X Virtual Frame Buffer Service
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 -ac +extension GLX +render -noreset

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target' \
  > /etc/systemd/system/xvfb.service"

Enable, start and check the status of the ``xvfb.service``:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl enable xvfb.service
   systemctl start xvfb.service
   systemctl status xvfb.service

Now restart Apache for the new configuration to be taken into account:

.. code-block:: bash

 systemctl restart apache2

With NGINX and spawn-fcgi using ``xvfb-run``:

.. code-block:: bash

 xvfb-run /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -f /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi \
                              -s /tmp/qgisserver.socket \
                              -G www-data -U www-data -n

The other option is to start a virtual X server environment with a specific
display number thanks to **Xvfb**:

.. code-block:: bash

 /usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 -ac +extension GLX +render -noreset

Then we just have to set the **DISPLAY** environment variable in the HTTP server
configuration. For example with NGINX:

.. code-block:: nginx

 fastcgi_param  DISPLAY       ":99";

Installation on Windows
=======================

.. index:: Windows

QGIS Server can also be installed on Windows systems. While the QGIS Server
package is available in the 64 bit version of the OSGeo4W network installer 
(https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) there is no Apache (or other
web server) package available, so this must be installed by other means.

A simple procedure is the following:

* Download the XAMPP installer (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
  for Windows and install Apache

.. figure:: img/qgis_server_windows1.png
  :align: center
  
* Download the OSGeo4W installer, follow the "Advanced Install" and install
  both the QGIS Desktop and QGIS Server packages
  
.. figure:: img/qgis_server_windows2.png
  :align: center
  
* Edit the httpd.conf file (:file:`C:\\xampp\\apache\\httpd.conf`
  if the default installation paths have been used) and make the following changes:

From:

.. code-block:: apache

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/xampp/cgi-bin/"


To:

.. code-block:: apache

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "c:/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis/bin/"


From:

.. code-block:: apache

    <Directory "C:/xampp/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Require all granted
    </Directory>


To:

.. code-block:: apache

    <Directory "c:/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis/bin">
    SetHandler cgi-script
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Require all granted
    </Directory>


From:

.. code-block:: apache

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .asp


To:

.. code-block:: apache

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .asp .exe


Then at the bottom of httpd.conf add:

.. code-block:: apache

    SetEnv GDAL_DATA "C:\OSGeo4W64\share\gdal"
    SetEnv QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\resources"
    SetEnv PYTHONHOME "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python37"
    SetEnv PATH "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem"
    SetEnv QGIS_PREFIX_PATH "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis"
    SetEnv QT_PLUGIN_PATH "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\qtplugins;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\plugins"


Restart the Apache web server from the XAMPP Control Panel and open browser window to testing
a GetCapabilities request to QGIS Server

::

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi.exe?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities


Serve a project
===============

Now that QGIS Server is installed and running, we just have to use it.

Obviously, we need a QGIS project to work on. Of course, you can fully
customize your project by defining contact information, precise some
restrictions on CRS or even exclude some layers. Everything you need to know
about that is described later in :ref:`Creatingwmsfromproject`.

But for now, we are going to use a simple project already configured and
previously downloaded in :file:`/home/qgis/projects/world.qgs`, as described above.

By opening the project and taking a quick look on layers, we know that 4
layers are currently available:

- airports
- places
- countries
- countries_shapeburst

You don't have to understand the full request for now but you may retrieve
a map with some of the previous layers thanks to QGIS Server by doing something
like this in your web browser to retrieve the *countries* layer:

.. code-block:: bash

  http://localhost/qgisserver?
    MAP=/home/qgis/projects/world.qgs&
    LAYERS=countries&
    SERVICE=WMS&
    REQUEST=GetMap&
    CRS=EPSG:4326&
    WIDTH=400&
    HEIGHT=200

If you obtain the next image, then QGIS Server is running correctly:

.. figure:: img/server_basic_getmap.png
  :align: center

  Server response to a basic GetMap request

Note that you may define **PROJECT_FILE** environment variable to use a project
by default instead of giving a **MAP** parameter (see :ref:`qgis-server-envvar`).

For example with spawn-fcgi:

.. code-block:: bash

 export PROJECT_FILE=/home/qgis/projects/world.qgs
 spawn-fcgi -f /usr/lib/bin/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi \
            -s /var/run/qgisserver.socket \
            -U www-data -G www-data -n

.. _`Creatingwmsfromproject`:

Configure your project
======================

To provide a new QGIS Server WMS, WFS or WCS, you have to create a QGIS project
file with some data or use one of your current project. Define the colors and
styles of the layers in QGIS and the project CRS, if not already defined.

.. _figure_server_definitions:

.. figure:: img/ows_server_definition.png
   :align: center

   Definitions for a QGIS Server WMS/WFS/WCS project

Then, go to the :guilabel:`QGIS Server` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Properties...` dialog and provide
some information about the OWS in the fields under
:guilabel:`Service Capabilities`.
This will appear in the GetCapabilities response of the WMS, WFS or WCS.
If you don't check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Service capabilities`,
QGIS Server will use the information given in the :file:`wms_metadata.xml` file
located in the :file:`cgi-bin` folder.

WMS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WMS capabilities` section, you can define
the extent advertised in the WMS GetCapabilities response by entering
the minimum and maximum X and Y values in the fields under
:guilabel:`Advertised extent`.
Clicking :guilabel:`Use Current Canvas Extent` sets these values to the
extent currently displayed in the QGIS map canvas.
By checking |checkbox| :guilabel:`CRS restrictions`, you can restrict
in which coordinate reference systems (CRS) QGIS Server will offer
to render maps. It is recommended that you restrict the offered CRS as this
reduces the size of the WMS GetCapabilities response.
Use the |signPlus| button below to select those CRSs
from the Coordinate Reference System Selector, or click :guilabel:`Used`
to add the CRSs used in the QGIS project to the list.

If you have print layouts defined in your project, they will be listed in the
`GetProjectSettings` response, and they can be used by the GetPrint request to
create prints, using one of the print layout layouts as a template.
This is a QGIS-specific extension to the WMS 1.3.0 specification.
If you want to exclude any print layout from being published by the WMS,
check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude layouts` and click the
|signPlus| button below.
Then, select a print layout from the :guilabel:`Select print layout` dialog
in order to add it to the excluded layouts list.

If you want to exclude any layer or layer group from being published by the
WMS, check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude Layers` and click the
|signPlus| button below.
This opens the :guilabel:`Select restricted layers and groups` dialog, which
allows you to choose the layers and groups that you don't want to be published.
Use the :kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:`Ctrl` key if you want to select multiple entries.
It is recommended that you exclude from publishing the layers that you don't
need as this reduces the size of the WMS GetCapabilities response which leads
to faster loading times on the client side.

You can receive requested GetFeatureInfo as plain text, XML and GML. Default is XML,
text or GML format depends the output format chosen for the GetFeatureInfo request.

If you wish, you can check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Add geometry to feature response`.
This will include in the GetFeatureInfo response the geometries of the
features in a text format.

As many web clients canâ€™t display circular arcs in geometries you have the option
to segmentize the geometry before sending it to the client in a GetFeatureInfo
response. This allows such clients to still display a featureâ€™s geometry
(e.g. for highlighting the feature). You need to check the
|checkbox| :guilabel:`Segmentize feature info geometry` to activate the option.

You can also use the :guilabel:`GetFeatureInfo geometry precision` option to
set the precision of the GetFeatureInfo geometry. This enables you to save
bandwidth when you don't need the full precision.

If you want QGIS Server to advertise specific request URLs
in the WMS GetCapabilities response, enter the corresponding URL in the
:guilabel:`Advertised URL` field.

Furthermore, you can restrict the maximum size of the maps returned by the
GetMap request by entering the maximum width and height into the respective
fields under :guilabel:`Maximums for GetMap request`.

If one of your layers uses the :ref:`Map Tip display <maptips>` (i.e. to show text using
expressions) this will be listed inside the GetFeatureInfo output. If the
layer uses a Value Map for one of its attributes, this information will also
be shown in the GetFeatureInfo output.

WFS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WFS capabilities` area you can select the layers you
want to publish as WFS, and specify if they will allow update, insert and
delete operations.
If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL` field of the
:guilabel:`WFS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise this specific
URL in the WFS GetCapabilities response.

WCS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` area, you can select the layers that you
want to publish as WCS. If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL`
field of the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise
this specific URL in the WCS GetCapabilities response.

Fine tuning your OWS
----------------------

For vector layers, the :guilabel:`Fields` menu of the :menuselection:`Layer -->
Layer Properties` dialog allows you to define for each
attribute if it will be published or not.
By default, all the attributes are published by your WMS and WFS.
If you don't want a specific attribute to be published, uncheck the corresponding
checkbox in the :guilabel:`WMS` or :guilabel:`WFS` column.

You can overlay watermarks over the maps produced by your WMS by adding text
annotations or SVG annotations to the project file.
See the :ref:`sec_annotations` section for instructions on
creating annotations. For annotations to be displayed as watermarks on the WMS
output, the :guilabel:`Fixed map position` checkbox in the
:guilabel:`Annotation text` dialog must be unchecked.
This can be accessed by double clicking the annotation while one of the
annotation tools is active.
For SVG annotations, you will need either to set the project to save absolute
paths (in the :guilabel:`General` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Properties...` dialog) or to manually modify
the path to the SVG image so that it represents a valid relative path.
