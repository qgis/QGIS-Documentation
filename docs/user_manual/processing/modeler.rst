The graphical modeler
=====================

The *graphical modeler* allows you to create complex models using
a simple and easy-to-use interface.
When working with a GIS, most analysis operations are not
isolated, rather part of a chain of operations.
Using the graphical modeler, that chain of operations can be wrapped
into a single process, making it convenient to execute later with a
different set of inputs.
No matter how many steps and different algorithms it involves, a
model is executed as a single algorithm, saving time and effort.

The graphical modeler can be opened from the Processing menu
(:menuselection:`Processing --> Graphical Modeler`).

The modeler has a working canvas where the structure of the model and
the workflow it represents are shown.
The left part of the window is a panel with two tabs that can be used
to add new elements to the model.

   Modeler

Creating a model involves two steps:

#. *Definition of necessary inputs*.
   These inputs will be added to the parameters window, so the user
   can set their values when executing the model.
   The model itself is an algorithm, so the parameters window is
   generated automatically as it happens with all the algorithms
   available in the processing framework.
#. *Definition of the workflow*.
   Using the input data of the model, the workflow is defined by
   adding algorithms and selecting how they use the defined inputs
   or the outputs generated by other algorithms in the model.

Definition of inputs
--------------------

The first step is to define the inputs for the model.
The following elements are found in the :guilabel:`Inputs` tab on
the left side of the modeler window. Hoovering with the mouse on the inputs will 
show a tooltip with additional information:

* Authentication Configuration
* Boolean
* Color
* Connection Name
* Coordinate Operation
* CRS
* Database Schema
* Database Table
* Datetime
* Distance
* Enum
* Expression
* Extent
* Fields Aggregate
* Fields Mapper
* File/Folder
* Map Layer
* Map Theme
* Matrix
* Multiple Input
* Number
* Point
* Print Layout
* Print Layout Item
* Range
* Raster Band
* Raster Layer
* Scale
* String
* Vector Features
* Vector Field
* Vector Layer
* Vector Tile Writer Layers

When double-clicking on an element, a dialog is shown that lets
you define its characteristics.
Depending on the parameter, the dialog will contain at least one basic
element (the description, which is what the user will see when
executing the model).
When adding a numerical value, as can be seen in the next figure,
in addition to the description of the parameter, you have to set a
default value and the range of valid values.

.. _figure_model_parameter:

   Model Parameters Definition

For each added input, a new element is added to the modeler canvas.

.. _figure_model_parameter_canvas:

.. figure:: img/models_parameters2.png
   :align: center

   Model Parameters

You can also add inputs by dragging the input type from the list and
dropping it in the position where you want it in the modeler canvas.

Definition of the workflow
--------------------------

Once the inputs have been defined, it is time to define the algorithms
of the model.
Algorithms can be found in the :guilabel:`Algorithms` tab, grouped
much in the same way as they are in the Processing toolbox.

.. _figure_model_parameter_inputs:

   Model Inputs


To add an algorithm to a model, double-click on its name or drag and
drop it, just like for inputs.
An execution dialog will appear, with a content similar to the one
found in the execution panel that is shown when executing the
algorithm from the toolbox.
The ones shown next correspond to the QGIS
'Drape (set Z value from raster)' algorithm and the QGIS 'Climb along
line' algorithm.

.. _figure_model_parameter_alg:

.. figure:: img/models_parameters4.png
   :align: center

   Model Algorithm parameters


As you can see, some differences exist.
Instead of the file output box that was used to set the file path for
output layers and tables, a simple text box is used here.
If the layer generated by the algorithm is just a temporary result
that will be used as the input of another algorithm and should not be
kept as a final result, just do not edit that text box.
Typing anything in it means that the result is final and the text that
you supply will be the description for the output, which will be the
output the user will see when executing the model.

Selecting the value of each parameter is also a bit different, since
there are important differences between the context of the modeler and
that of the toolbox.
Let's see how to introduce the values for each type of parameter.

* Layers (raster and vector) and tables.
  These are selected from a list, but in this case, the possible values
  are not the layers or tables currently loaded in QGIS, but the list
  of model inputs of the corresponding type, or other layers or
  tables generated by algorithms already added to the model.
* Numerical values.
  Literal values can be introduced directly in the text box.
  Clicking on the button beside the text box, expressions can be entered.
  Available variables for expressions include numerical inputs of the
  model, outputs from model algorithms and also statistical values from
  available layers within the model.
* String.
  Literal strings can be typed in the corresponding text box.
  Clicking on the button beside the text box, expressions can be entered,
  as for numerical values.
* Vector Field.
  The fields of a vector layer cannot be known at design time, since they
  depend on the selection of the user each time the model is executed.
  To set the value for this parameter, type the name of a field directly
  in the text box, or use the list to select a table field.
  The validity of the selected field will be checked at run time.

In all cases, you will find an additional parameter named
*Parent algorithms* that is not available when calling the algorithm
from the toolbox.
This parameter allows you to define the order in which algorithms are
executed by explicitly defining one algorithm as a parent of the current
one, which will force the parent algorithm to be executed before the
current one.

When you use the output of a previous algorithm as the input of your
algorithm, that implicitly sets the previous algorithm as parent of the
current one (and places the corresponding arrow in the modeler canvas).
However, in some cases an algorithm might depend on another one even if
it does not use any output object from it (for instance, an algorithm
that executes a SQL sentence on a PostGIS database and another one that
imports a layer into that same database).
In that case, just select the previous algorithm in the
*Parent algorithms* parameter and they will be executed in the correct
order.

Once all the parameters have been assigned valid values, click on
:guilabel:`OK` and the algorithm will be added to the canvas.
It will be linked to the elements in the canvas (algorithms or inputs)
that provide objects that are used as inputs for the algorithm.

Elements can be dragged to a different position on the canvas.
This is useful to make the structure of the model more clear and
intuitive.
Links between elements are updated automatically.
You can zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel.

   A complete model


You can run your algorithm any time by clicking on the :guilabel:`Run`
button.
In order to use the algorithm from the toolbox, it has to be saved
and the modeler dialog closed, to allow the toolbox to refresh its
contents.

Saving and loading models
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the current model and the
:guilabel:`Open` button to open any previously saved model.
Models are saved with the :file:`.model3` extension.
If the model has been already been saved from the modeler window,
you will not be prompted for a filename.
Since there is already a file associated with the model, that file
will be used for subsequent saves.

Before saving a model, you have to enter a name and a group for it
in the text boxes in the upper part of the window.

Models saved in the :file:`models` folder (the default folder when you
are prompted for a filename to save the model) will appear in the
toolbox in the corresponding branch.
When the toolbox is invoked, it searches the :file:`models` folder for
files with the :file:`.model3` extension and loads the models they
contain.
Since a model is itself an algorithm, it can be added to the toolbox
just like any other algorithm.

Models can also be saved within the project file using the
|addToProject|:sup:`Save model in project` button.
Models saved using this method won't be written as :file:`.model3` files
on the disk but will be embedded in the project file.

Project models are available in the
|qgsProjectFile|:guilabel:`Project models` menu of the toolbox.

The models folder can be set from the Processing configuration dialog,
under the :guilabel:`Modeler` group.

Models loaded from the :file:`models` folder appear not only in the
toolbox, but also in the algorithms tree in the :guilabel:`Algorithms`
tab of the modeler window.
That means that you can incorporate a model as a part of a bigger model,
just like other algorithms.

Models will show up in the :ref:`Browser <browser_panel>` panel , and
can be run from there.

Exporting a model as an image, PDF or SVG
.........................................

A model can also be exported as an image, SVG or PDF (for illustration
purposes).


Editing a model
---------------

You can edit the model you are currently creating, redefining the
workflow and the relationships between the algorithms and inputs that
define the model.

If you right-click on an algorithm in the canvas, you will see a context
menu like the one shown next:

.. _figure_model_right_click:

.. figure:: img/modeler_right_click.png
   :align: center

   Modeler Right Click

Selecting the :guilabel:`Remove` option will cause the selected
algorithm to be removed.
An algorithm can be removed only if there are no other algorithms
depending on it.
That is, if no output from the algorithm is used in a different one as
input.
If you try to remove an algorithm that has others depending on it, a
warning message like the one you can see below will be shown:

.. _figure_cannot_delete_alg:

.. figure:: img/cannot_delete_alg.png
   :align: center

   Cannot Delete Algorithm

Selecting the :guilabel:`Edit` option will show the parameter dialog
of the algorithm, so you can change the inputs and parameter values.
Not all input elements available in the model will appear as
available inputs.
Layers or values generated at a more advanced step in the workflow
defined by the model will not be available if they cause circular
dependencies.

Select the new values and click on the :guilabel:`OK` button as usual.
The connections between the model elements will change in the modeler
canvas accordingly.

A model can be run partially, by deactivating some of its algorithms.
To do it, select the :guilabel:`Deactivate` option in the context menu
that appears when right-clicking on an algorithm element.
The selected algorithm, and all the ones in the model that depend on it
will be displayed in grey and will not be executed as part of the model.

.. _figure_cannot_model_deactivate:

.. figure:: img/deactivated.png
   :align: center

   Model With Deactivated Algorithms

When right-clicking on an algorithm that is not active, you will
see a :guilabel:`Activate` menu option that you can use to reactivate
it.

Editing model help files and meta-information
---------------------------------------------

You can document your models from the modeler itself.
Just click on the :guilabel:`Edit Model Help` button, and a dialog
like the one shown next will appear.

.. _figure_help_edition:

.. figure:: img/help_edition.png
   :align: center

   Editing Help

On the right-hand side, you will see a simple HTML page, created using
the description of the input parameters and outputs of the algorithm,
along with some additional items like a general description of the
model or its author.
The first time you open the help editor, all these descriptions are
empty, but you can edit them using the elements on the left-hand side
of the dialog.
Select an element on the upper part and then write its description in
the text box below.

Model help is saved as part of the model itself.


Exporting a model as a Python script
--------------------------------------

As we will see in a later chapter, Processing algorithms can be called
from the QGIS Python console, and new Processing algorithms can be
created using Python.
A quick way of creating such a Python script is to create a model and
then to export is as a Python file.

To do so, right click on the name of the model in the Processing
Toolbox and choose :guilabel:`Export Model as Python Algorithm...`.


About available algorithms
--------------------------

You might notice that some algorithms that can be executed from the
toolbox do not appear in the list of available algorithms when you are
designing a model.
To be included in a model, an algorithm must have the correct
semantic.
If an algorithm does not have such a well-defined semantic (for
instance, if the number of output layers cannot be known in advance),
then it is not possible to use it within a model, and it will not
appear in the list of algorithms that you can find in the modeler
dialog.

   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
