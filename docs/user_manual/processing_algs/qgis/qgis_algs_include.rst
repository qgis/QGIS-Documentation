**geometric_predicates**

.. The following section is included in vector selection algorithms such as
 qgisselectbylocation, qgisextractbylocation
 
.. figure:: img/selectbylocation.png
   :align: center
       
   In this example, the dataset from which we want to select (the *source
   vector layer*) consists of the green circles, the orange rectangle is the
   dataset that it is being compared to (the *intersection vector layer*).

Available geometric predicates are:

*Intersect*
  Tests whether a geometry intersects another. Returns 1 (true) if the
  geometries spatially intersect (share any portion of space - overlap or touch) and 0 if they
  donâ€™t. In the picture above, this will select circles 1, 2 and 3.

*Contain*
  Returns 1 (true) if and only if no points of b lie in the exterior of a,
  and at least one point of the interior of b lies in the interior of a.
  In the picture, no circle is selected, but the rectangle would be if you
  would select it the other way around, as it contains a circle completely.
  This is the opposite of *are within*.

*Disjoint*
  Returns 1 (true) if the geometries do not share any portion of space (no overlap, not touching).
  Only circle 4 is selected.

*Equal*
  Returns 1 (true) if and only if geometries are exactly the same.
  No circles will be selected.

*Touch*
  Tests whether a geometry touches another. Returns 1 (true) if the geometries
  have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.
  Only circle 3 is selected.

*Overlap*
  Tests whether a geometry overlaps another. Returns 1 (true) if the geometries
  share space, are of the same dimension, but are not completely contained by
  each other. Only circle 2 is selected.

*Are within*
  Tests whether a geometry is within another. Returns 1 (true) if geometry a
  is completely inside geometry b. Only circle 1 is selected.

*Cross*
  Returns 1 (true) if the supplied geometries have some, but not all, interior
  points in common and the actual crossing is of a lower dimension than the
  highest supplied geometry. For example, a line crossing a polygon will cross
  as a line (selected). Two lines crossing will cross as a point (selected).
  Two polygons cross as a polygon (not selected).

**algorithm_code_section**

.. The following section is used to load python code sample in algs help

.. code-block:: python

    import processing
    processing.run("algorithm_id", {parameter_dictionary})

The *algorithm id* is displayed when you hover over the algorithm in
the Processing Toolbox.
The *parameter dictionary* provides the parameter NAMEs and values.
See :ref:`processing_console` for details on how to run processing algorithms
from the Python console.
