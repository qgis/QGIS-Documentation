QGIS algorithm provider
***********************

QGIS algorithm provider implements various analysis and geoprocessing operations
using mostly only QGIS API. So almost all algorithms from this provider will work
"out of the box" without any additional configuration.

This provider incorporates some algorithms from plugins and also adds its own
algorithms.
