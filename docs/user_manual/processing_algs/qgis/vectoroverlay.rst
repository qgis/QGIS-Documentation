.. _qgisclip:

Clip
----
Clips a vector layer using the features of an additional polygon
layer.

Only the parts of the features in the input layer that fall within the
polygons of the overlay layer will be added to the resulting layer.

.. include:: ../algs_include.rst

This algorithm uses spatial indexes on the providers, prepared
geometries and apply a clipping operation if the geometry isn't wholly
contained by the mask geometry.

.. _qgisunion:

Union
-----
Checks overlaps between features within the input layer and creates
separate features for overlapping and non-overlapping parts.
The area of overlap will create as many identical overlapping features
as there are features that participate in that overlap.

.. figure:: img/union.png
  :align: center

  Union operation with a single input layer with two overlapping
  features (left) - resulting in four features (middle) - features moved for clarity (right)

An overlay layer can also be used, in which case features from each
layer are split at their overlap with features from the other one,
creating a layer containing all the portions from both input and
overlay layers. Features on the same layer will not split each other.
The attribute table of the union layer is filled with attribute values
from the respective original layer for non-overlapping features, and
attribute values from both layers for overlapping features.

.. figure:: img/union_with_overlay.png
  :align: center

  Union operation between a two-feature input layer 'a' and a single
  feature overlay layer 'b' (left) - resulting five-feature layer 
  with attributes from both layers (right)

.. note::
   With an overlay layer, features on the same layer will not split each other.
   If you want to split overlaps on the same layer as well as other layers,
   first run the algorithm with multiple layers then run the algorithm
   again with only the previous output.

.. _qgismultiunion:

Union (multiple)
----------------

Checks overlaps between features within the input layer and creates
separate features for overlapping and non-overlapping parts.
The area of overlap will create as many identical overlapping features
as there are features that participate in that overlap.

.. figure:: img/union.png
  :align: center

  Union operation with a single input layer with two overlapping
  features (left) - resulting in four features (middle) - features moved for clarity (right)

Multiple overlay layers can also be used, in which case features from each
layer are split at their overlap with features from all other layers,
creating a layer containing all the portions from both input and
overlay layers. Features on the same layer will not split each other.
The attribute table of the Union layer is filled with attribute values
from the respective original layer for non-overlapping features, and
attribute values from overlay layers for overlapping features.

.. figure:: img/union_multi.png
  :align: center

  Union operation between a two-feature input layer 'a' and single
  feature overlay layers 'b' and 'c' (left) - resulting eleven-feature layer 
  with attributes from all layers (right)

.. note::
   With an overlay layer, features on the same layer will not split each other.
   If you want to split overlaps on the same layer as well as other layers,
   first run the algorithm with multiple layers then run the algorithm
   again with only the previous output.
