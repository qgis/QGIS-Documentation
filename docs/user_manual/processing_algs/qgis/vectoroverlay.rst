.. _qgisclip:

Clip
----
Clips a vector layer using the features of an additional polygon
layer.

Only the parts of the features in the input layer that fall within the
polygons of the overlay layer will be added to the resulting layer.

.. _warning_difference:

.. warning:: **Feature modification**

   The attributes of the features are **not modified**, although
   properties such as area or length of the features will be modified
   by the clipping operation.
   If such properties are stored as attributes, those attributes will
   have to be manually updated.

This algorithm uses spatial indexes on the providers, prepared
geometries and apply a clipping operation if the geometry isn't wholly
contained by the mask geometry.

Difference
----------

.. _qgisunion:

Union
-----
Checks overlaps between features within the input layer and creates
separate features for overlapping and non-overlapping parts.
The area of overlap will create as many identical overlapping features
as there are features that participate in that overlap.

.. figure:: img/union.png
  :align: center

  Union operation with a single input layer of three overlapping
  features (left) - resulting features are moved for clarity (right)

An overlay layer can also be used, in which case features from each
layer are split at their overlap with features from the other one,
creating a layer containing all the portions from both input and
overlay layers.
The attribute table of the union layer is filled with attribute values
from the respective original layer for non-overlapping features, and
attribute values from both layers for overlapping features.

.. figure:: img/union_with_overlay.png
  :align: center

  Union operation between a two-features input layer and a single

.. note::
   For ``union(A,B)`` algorithm, if there are overlaps among
   geometries of layer A or among geometries of layer B, these are not
   resolved: you need to do ``union(union(A,B))`` to resolve all
   overlaps, i.e. run single layer ``union(X)`` on the produced result
   ``X=union(A,B)``.
