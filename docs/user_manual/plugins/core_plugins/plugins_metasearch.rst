Introduction
------------

MetaSearch is a QGIS plugin to interact with metadata catalog services,
supporting the OGC Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) standard.

MetaSearch provides an easy and intuitive approach and user-friendly
interface to searching metadata catalogs within QGIS.

Working with Metadata Catalogs in QGIS
--------------------------------------

MetaSearch is included by default in QGIS, with all of its dependencies,
and can be enabled from the QGIS Plugin Manager.

CSW (Catalog Service for the Web)
...................................

`CSW (Catalog Service for the Web)`_ is an
`OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)`_ specification that defines common
interfaces to discover, browse and query metadata about data, services,
and other potential resources.

Startup
.......

To start MetaSearch, click the |metasearch| icon or select
:menuselection:`Web --> MetaSearch --> MetaSearch` via the QGIS main menu.
The MetaSearch dialog will appear.
The main GUI consists of three tabs: :guilabel:`Services`,
:guilabel:`Search` and :guilabel:`Settings`.

Managing Catalog Services
.........................

   Managing Catalog Services

The :guilabel:`Services` tab allows the user to manage all available
catalog services.
MetaSearch provides a default list of Catalog Services, which can be
added by pressing the :guilabel:`Add Default Services` button.

To find all listed Catalog Service entries, click the dropdown select box.

To add a Catalog Service entry:

#. Click the :guilabel:`New` button
#. Enter a :guilabel:`Name` for the service, as well as the
   :guilabel:`URL` (endpoint).
   Note that only the base URL is required (not a full GetCapabilities URL).
#. If the CSW requires authentication, enter the appropriate
   :guilabel:`User name` and :guilabel:`Password` credentials.
#. Click :guilabel:`OK` to add the service to the list of entries.

To edit an existing Catalog Service entry:

#. Select the entry you would like to edit
#. Click the :guilabel:`Edit` button
#. And modify the :guilabel:`Name` or :guilabel:`URL` values
#. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

To delete a Catalog Service entry, select the entry you would like to
delete and click the :guilabel:`Delete` button.
You will be asked to confirm deleting the entry.

MetaSearch allows loading and saving connections to an XML file.
This is useful when you need to share settings between applications.
Below is an example of the XML file format.

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <qgsCSWConnections version="1.0">

      <csw name="UNEP/GRID-Geneva Metadata Catalog" url="http://metadata.grid.unep.ch:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw"/>
  </qgsCSWConnections>


To load a list of entries:

#. Click the :guilabel:`Load` button. A new window will appear.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Browse` button and navigate to the XML file of
   entries you wish to load.
#. Click :guilabel:`Open`. The list of entries will be displayed.
#. Select the entries you wish to add from the list and click
   :guilabel:`Load`.

Click the :guilabel:`Service Info` button to display information about
the selected Catalog Service such as service identification, service
provider and contact information.
If you would like to view the raw XML response, click the
:guilabel:`GetCapabilities Response` button.
A separate window will open displaying the Capabilities XML.

Searching Catalog Services
..........................

.. _figure_metasearch_search:

   Searching catalog services

The :guilabel:`Search` tab allows the user to query Catalog Services
for data and services, set various search parameters and view results.

The following search parameters are available:

* :guilabel:`Keywords`: free text search keywords;
* :guilabel:`From`: the Catalog Service to perform the query against;
* **Bounding box**: the spatial area of interest to filter, defined
  by :guilabel:`Xmax`, :guilabel:`Xmin`, :guilabel:`Ymax`, and
  :guilabel:`Ymin`.
  Click :guilabel:`Set  Global` to do a  global search, click
  :guilabel:`Map Extent` to do a search in the visible area, or
  enter values manually.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Search` button will search the selected Metadata Catalog.
Search results are displayed in a list, and can be sorted by clicking on
the column header.
You can navigate through search results with the directional buttons
below the search results.

Select a result and:

* Click the :guilabel:`View Search Results as XML` button to open a
  window with the service response in raw XML format.
* If the metadata record has an associated bounding box, a footprint
  of the bounding box will be displayed on the map.
* Double-click the record to display the record metadata with any
  associated access links.
  Clicking a link opens the link in the user's web browser.
* If the record is a supported web service (WMS/WMTS, WFS, WCS,
  ArcGIS Map Service, ArcGIS Feature Service, etc.), the
  :guilabel:`Add Data` button will be enabled.
  When clicking this button, MetaSearch will verify if this is a
  valid OWS.
  The service will then be added to the appropriate QGIS connection
  list, and the appropriate connection dialog will appear.

   MetaSearch settings

You can fine tune MetaSearch with the following :guilabel:`Settings`:

* :guilabel:`Server Timeout`: when searching metadata catalogs, the
  number of seconds for blocking connection attempt.
  Default value is 10.
* :guilabel:`Results paging`: when searching metadata catalogs, the
  number of results to show per page. Default value is 10.

CSW Server Errors
-----------------

In some cases, the CSW will work in a web browser, but not in MetaSearch.
This may be due to the CSW server's configuration/setup.
CSW server providers should ensure URLs are consistent and up to date in
their configuration (this is common in HTTP -> HTTPS redirection scenarios).
Please see the `pycsw FAQ item`_ for a deeper explanation of the issue and fix.
Although the FAQ item is pycsw specific it can also apply in general to other
CSW servers.
