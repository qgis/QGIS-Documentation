The Biodiversity Informatics Facility at the American Museum of Natural History's
(AMNH) Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC)
has developed the Event Visualization Tool (eVis), another software tool to add
to the suite of conservation monitoring and decision support tools for guiding
protected area and landscape planning. This plugin enables users to easily link
geocoded (i.e., referenced with latitude and longitude or X and Y coordinates)
photographs, and other supporting documents, to vector data in QGIS.

eVis is now automatically installed and enabled in new versions of QGIS, and as
with all plugins, it can be disabled and enabled using the Plugin Manager
(see :ref:`managing_plugins`).

The eVis plugin is made up of three modules: the 'Database Connection tool',
'Event ID tool', and the 'Event Browser'. These work together to allow viewing of
geocoded photographs and other documents that are linked to features stored in
vector files, databases, or spreadsheets.

.. _`evis_browser`:

Event Browser
-------------

The Event Browser module provides the functionality to display geocoded
photographs that are linked to vector features displayed in the QGIS map window.
Point data, for example, can be from a vector file that can be input using QGIS
or it can be from the result of a database query. The vector feature must have
attribute information associated with it to describe the location and name of
the file containing the photograph and, optionally, the compass direction the
camera was pointed when the image was acquired. Your vector layer must be loaded
into QGIS before running the Event Browser.

.. _`evis_launch_browser`:

Launch the Event Browser module
...............................

To launch the Event Browser module, click on :menuselection:`Database --> eVis -->`
|eventBrowser| :menuselection:`eVis Event Browser`. This will open the
:guilabel:`Generic Event Browser` window.

The :guilabel:`Event Browser` window has three tabs displayed at the top
of the window. The :guilabel:`Display` tab is used to view the photograph and its
associated attribute data. The :guilabel:`Options` tab provides a number of
settings that can be adjusted to control the behavior of the eVis plugin. Lastly,
the :guilabel:`Configure External Applications` tab is used to maintain a table
of file extensions and their associated application to allow eVis to display
documents other than images.

.. _`evis_display_window`:

Understanding the Display window
................................

To see the :guilabel:`Display` window, click on the :guilabel:`Display` tab in the
:guilabel:`Event Browser` window. The :guilabel:`Display` window is used
to view geocoded photographs and their associated attribute data.

.. _figure_eVis:

.. figure:: img/evisdisplay.png
   :align: center

   The *eVis* display window

A. **Display window**: A window where the photograph will appear.
B. **Zoom in button**: Zoom in to see more detail. If the entire image cannot be
   displayed in the display window, scroll bars will appear on the left and bottom
   sides of the window to allow you to pan around the image.
C. **Zoom out button**: Zoom out to see more area.
D. **Zoom to full extent** button: Displays the full extent of the photograph.
E. **Attribute information window**: All of the attribute information for the
   point associated with the photograph being viewed is displayed here. If the
   file type being referenced in the displayed record is not an image but is of
   a file type defined in the :guilabel:`Configure External Applications` tab,
   then when you double-click on the value of the field containing the path to
   the file, the application to open the file will be launched to view or hear
   the contents of the file. If the file extension is recognized, the attribute
   data will be displayed in green.
F. **Navigation buttons**: Use the Previous and Next buttons to load the previous
   or next feature when more than one feature is selected.

.. _`evis_options_window`:

Understanding the Options window
................................

.. _figure_eVis_options:

.. figure:: img/evisoptions.png
   :align: center

   The *eVis* Options window

A. **File path**: A drop-down list to specify the attribute field that contains
   the directory path or URL for the photographs or other documents being
   displayed. If the location is a relative path, then the checkbox must be
   clicked. The base path for a relative path can be entered in the :guilabel:`Base
   Path` text box below. Information about the different options for specifying
   the file location are noted in the section :ref:`evis_specifying` below.
B. **Compass bearing**: A drop-down list to specify the attribute
   field that contains the compass bearing associated with the photograph being
   displayed. If compass bearing information is available, it is necessary to
   click the checkbox below the drop-down menu title.
C. **Compass offset**: Compass offsets can be used to compensate for
   declination (to adjust bearings collected using magnetic bearings to true north
   bearings). Click the |radioButtonOn| :guilabel:`Manual` radio button to enter
   the offset in the text box or click the |radioButtonOn|
   :guilabel:`From Attribute` radio button to select the attribute field
   containing the offsets. For both of these options, east declinations should
   be entered using positive values, and west declinations should use negative
   values.
D. **Directory base path**: The base path onto which the relative path defined
   in Figure_eVis_options_ (A) will be appended.
E. **Replace path**: If this checkbox is checked, only the file name from A
   will be appended to the base path.
F. **Apply rule to all documents**: If checked, the same path rules that are
   defined for photographs will be used for non-image documents such as movies,
   text documents, and sound files. If not checked, the path rules will only
   apply to photographs, and other documents will ignore the base path parameter.
G. **Remember settings**: If the checkbox is checked, the values for the associated
   parameters will be saved for the next session when the window is closed or
   when the :guilabel:`Save` button below is pressed.
H. **Reset values**: Resets the values on this line to the default setting.
I. **Restore defaults**: This will reset all of the fields to their default
   settings. It has the same effect as clicking all of the :guilabel:`Reset` buttons.
J. **Save**: This will save the settings without closing the :guilabel:`Options`
   pane.

.. _`evis_external_window`:

Understanding the Configure External Applications window
........................................................

.. _figure_eVis_app:

.. figure:: img/evisexternal.png
   :align: center

   The *eVis* External Applications window


A. **File reference table**: A table containing file types that can be opened
   using eVis. Each file type needs a file extension and the path to an
   application that can open that type of file. This provides the capability
   of opening a broad range of files such as movies, sound recordings, and text
   documents instead of only images.
B. **Add new file type**: Add a new file type with a unique extension and the
   path for the application that can open the file.
C. **Delete current row**: Delete the file type highlighted in the table and
   defined by a file extension and a path to an associated application.

.. _`evis_specifying`:

Specifying the location and name of a photograph
------------------------------------------------

The location and name of the photograph can be stored using an absolute or
relative path, or a URL if the photograph is available on a web server. Examples
of the different approaches are listed in Table `evis_examples`_.

.. _`evis_examples`:

::

  X        Y        FILE                                                BEARING

                    attachment_id-12                                    76


.. _`evis_location`:

Specifying the location and name of other supporting documents
--------------------------------------------------------------

Supporting documents such as text documents, videos, and sound clips can also
be displayed or played by eVis. To do this, it is necessary to add an entry in
the file reference table that can be accessed from the :guilabel:`Configure External
Applications` window in the :guilabel:`Generic Event Browser` that matches the
file extension to an application that can be used to open the file. It is also
necessary to have the path or URL to the file in the attribute table for the
vector layer. One additional rule that can be used for URLs that don't contain
a file extension for the document you want to open is to specify the file
extension before the URL. The format is --- ``file extension:URL``. The URL is
preceded by the file extension and a colon; this is particularly useful for
accessing documents from wikis and other web sites that use a database to
manage the web pages (see Table `evis_examples`_).

.. _`evis_using_browser`:

Using the Event Browser
-----------------------

When the :guilabel:`Event Browser` window opens, a photograph will appear in the
display window if the document referenced in the vector file attribute table is
an image and if the file location information in the :guilabel:`Options` window
is properly set. If a photograph is expected and it does not appear, it will be
necessary to adjust the parameters in the :guilabel:`Options` window.

If a supporting document (or an image that does not have a file extension
recognized by eVis) is referenced in the attribute table, the field containing
the file path will be highlighted in green in the attribute information window
if that file extension is defined in the file reference table located in the
:guilabel:`Configure External Applications` window. To open the document,
double-click on the green-highlighted line in the attribute information window.
If a supporting document is referenced in the attribute information window and
the file path is not highlighted in green, then it will be necessary to add an
entry for the file's filename extension in the :guilabel:`Configure External
Applications` window. If the file path is highlighted in green but does not open
when double-clicked, it will be necessary to adjust the parameters in the
:guilabel:`Options` window so the file can be located by eVis.

If no compass bearing is provided in the :guilabel:`Options` window, a red asterisk
will be displayed on top of the vector feature that is associated with the
photograph being displayed. If a compass bearing is provided, then an arrow will
appear pointing in the direction indicated by the value in the compass bearing
display field in the :guilabel:`Event Browser` window. The arrow will be
centered over the point that is associated with the photograph or other document.

To close the :guilabel:`Event Browser` window, click on the :guilabel:`Close`
button from the :guilabel:`Display` window.

.. _`evis_id_tool`:

Event ID Tool
-------------

The 'Event ID' module allows you to display a photograph by clicking on a feature
displayed in the QGIS map window. The vector feature must have attribute
information associated with it to describe the location and name of the file
containing the photograph and, optionally, the compass direction the camera was
pointed when the image was acquired. This layer must be loaded into QGIS before
running the 'Event ID' tool.

.. _`evis_launch_id`:

Launch the Event ID module
..........................

To launch the 'Event ID' module, either click on the |eventId| :sup:`Event ID`
icon or click on :menuselection:`Database --> eVis --> Event ID Tool`. This will
cause the cursor to change to an arrow with an 'i' on top of it signifying that
the ID tool is active.

To view the photographs linked to vector features in the active vector layer
displayed in the QGIS map window, move the Event ID cursor over the feature and
then click the mouse. After clicking on the feature, the :guilabel:`Event
Browser` window is opened and the photographs on or near the clicked locality are
available for display in the browser. If more than one photograph is available,
you can cycle through the different features using the :guilabel:`Previous` and
:guilabel:`Next` buttons. The other controls are described in the :ref:`evis_browser`
section of this guide.

.. _`evis_database`:

Database connection
-------------------

The 'Database Connection' module provides tools to connect to and query a
database or other ODBC resource, such as a spreadsheet.

eVis can directly connect to the following types of databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite;
it can also read from ODBC connections (e.g., MS Access). When reading from an
ODBC database (such as an Excel spreadsheet), it is necessary to configure your
ODBC driver for the operating system you are using.

.. _`evis_launch_database`:

Launch the Database Connection module
.....................................

To launch the 'Database Connection' module, either click on the appropriate icon
|evisConnect| :sup:`eVis Database Connection` or click on :menuselection:`Database -->
eVis --> Database Connection`. This will launch the :guilabel:`Database Connection`
window. The window has three tabs: :guilabel:`Predefined Queries`,
:guilabel:`Database Connection`, and :guilabel:`SQL Query`. The :guilabel:`Output
Console` window at the bottom of the window displays the status of actions
initiated by the different sections of this module.

.. _`evis_connect_database`:

Connect to a database
.....................

Click on the :guilabel:`Database Connection` tab to open the database
connection interface. Next, use the :menuselection:`Database Type` |selectString|
combo box to select the type of database that you want to connect to. If a
password or username is required, that information can be entered in the
:guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` textboxes.

Enter the database host in the :guilabel:`Database Host` textbox. This option is
not available if you selected 'MS Access' as the database type. If the database
resides on your desktop, you should enter "localhost".

Enter the name of the database in the :guilabel:`Database Name` textbox. If you
selected 'ODBC' as the database type, you need to enter the data source name.

When all of the parameters are filled in, click on the :guilabel:`Connect` button.
If the connection is successful, a message will be written in the :guilabel:`Output
Console` window stating that the connection was established. If a connection was
not established, you will need to check that the correct parameters were entered
above.

M. **OK**: Closes the main "Database Connection" window.


.. _`evis_running_sql`:

Running SQL queries
...................

SQL queries are used to extract information from a database or ODBC resource.
In eVis, the output from these queries is a vector layer added to the QGIS map
window. Click on the :guilabel:`SQL Query` tab to display the SQL query
interface. SQL commands can be entered in this text window. A helpful tutorial
on SQL commands is available at https://www.w3schools.com/sql. For example, to
extract all of the data from a worksheet in an Excel file, ``select * from [sheet1$]``
where ``sheet1`` is the name of the worksheet.

Click on the :guilabel:`Run Query` button to execute the command. If the query
is successful, a :guilabel:`Database File Selection` window will be displayed. If
the query is not successful, an error message will appear in the :guilabel:`Output
Console` window.

In the :guilabel:`Database File Selection` window, enter the name of the layer
that will be created from the results of the query in the :guilabel:`Name of New
Layer` textbox.

.. _figure_eVis_sql:

.. figure:: img/evissql_query.png
   :align: center

   The eVis SQL query tab

A. **SQL Query Text Window**: A screen to type SQL queries.
B. **Run Query**: Button to execute the query entered in the :guilabel:`SQL Query
   Window`.
C. **Console Window**: The console window where messages related to processing
   are displayed.

E. **OK**: Closes the main :guilabel:`Database Connection` window.

Use the :guilabel:`X Coordinate` |selectString| and :guilabel:`Y Coordinate`
|selectString| combo boxes to select the fields from the database that stores the
``X`` (or longitude) and ``Y`` (or latitude) coordinates. Clicking on the :guilabel:`OK`
button causes the vector layer created from the SQL query to be displayed in the
QGIS map window.

To save this vector file for future use, you can use the QGIS 'Save as...'
command that is accessed by right-clicking on the layer name in the QGIS map
legend and then selecting 'Save as...'

.. tip:: **Creating a vector layer from a Microsoft Excel Worksheet**

   When creating a vector layer from a Microsoft Excel Worksheet, you might see
   that unwanted zeros ("0") have been inserted in the attribute table rows
   beneath valid data. This can be caused by deleting the values for these cells
   in Excel using the :kbd:`Backspace` key. To correct this problem, you need to
   open the Excel file (you'll need to close QGIS if you are connected
   to the file, to allow you to edit the file) and then use
   :menuselection:`Edit --> Delete` to remove the blank rows from the file. To
   avoid this problem, you can simply delete several rows in the Excel Worksheet
   using :menuselection:`Edit --> Delete` before saving the file.


.. _`evis_predefined`:

Running predefined queries
..........................

With predefined queries, you can select previously written queries stored in XML
format in a file. This is particularly helpful if you are not familiar with SQL
commands. Click on the :guilabel:`Predefined Queries` tab to display the
predefined query interface.

To load a set of predefined queries, click on the |folder| :sup:`Open File`
icon. This opens the :guilabel:`Open File` window, which is used to locate the file
containing the SQL queries. When the queries are loaded, their titles as
defined in the XML file will appear in the drop-down menu located just below
the |folder| :sup:`Open File` icon. The full description of the query is
displayed in the text window under the drop-down menu.

Select the query you want to run from the drop-down menu and then click on the
:guilabel:`SQL Query` tab to see that the query has been loaded into the query
window. If it is the first time you are running a predefined query or are
switching databases, you need to be sure to connect to the database.

Click on the :guilabel:`Run Query` button in the :guilabel:`SQL Query` tab to execute
the command. If the query is successful, a :guilabel:`Database File Selection`
window will be displayed. If the query is not successful, an error message will
appear in the :guilabel:`Output Console` window.

.. _figure_eVis_queries:
