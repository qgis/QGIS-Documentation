The Browser panel
======================================================================

The QGIS Browser panel is a great tool for browsing, searching,
inspecting, copying and loading QGIS resources.
Only resources that QGIS knows how to handle are shown in the
browser.

Using the Browser panel you can locate, inspect and add data, as
described in :ref:`browser_panel`.
In addition, the Browser panel supports drag and drop of many QGIS
resources, such as project files, Python scripts, Processing scripts and 
Processing models.

Python scripts, Processing scripts and Processing models can also be opened for 
editing in an external editor and the graphical modeller.

You can drag and drop layers from the :guilabel:`Layers` panel
to the :guilabel:`Browser` panel, for instance into a GeoPackage or a
PostGIS database.

   The Browser panel

The browser panel (:numref:`figure_browser_panel`) is organised
as an expandable hierarchy with some fixed top-level entries that
organise the resources handled by the browser.
Node entries are expanded by clicking on |browserExpand| to the left
of the entry name.
A branch is collapsed by clicking on |browserCollapse|.
The |collapseTree| :sup:`Collapse All` button collapses all top-level
entries.

In :menuselection:`Settings --> Interface Customization` it is
possible to disable resources.
If you, for instance, would not like to show Python scripts in the
browser, you can uncheck the :menuselection:`Browser --> py` entry,
and if you want to get rid of your home folder in the browser, you
can uncheck the :menuselection:`Browser --> special:Home` entry.

A filter (|filterMap| :sup:`Filter Browser`) can be used for searching
based on entry names (both leaf entries and node entries in the
hierarchy).
Using the |options| :sup:`Options` pull-down menu next to the filter
text field, you can

* toggle :guilabel:`Case Sensitive` search
* set the :guilabel:`Filter pattern syntax` to one of

  * :guilabel:`Normal`
  * :guilabel:`Wildcard(s)`
  * :guilabel:`Regular Expressions`

The *Properties widget*, showing useful information about some
entries / resources, can be enabled / disabled using the |metadata|
:sup:`Enable/disable properties widget` button.
When enabled, it opens at the bottom of the browser panel, as shown in
:numref:`figure_properties_widget`.

   The properties widget

A second browser panel can be opened by activating the
:guilabel:`Browser (2)` panel in :menuselection:`View --> Panels`.
Having two browser panels can be useful when copying layers between
resources that are locationed deep down in different branches of the
browser hierarchy.


Resources that can be opened / run from the Browser
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot can be accomplished in the Browser panel

* Add vector, raster and mesh layers to your map by double-clicking,
  dragging onto the map canvas or clicking the |addLayer|
  :sup:`Add Selected Layers` button (after selecting layers)
* Run Python scripts (including Processing algorithms) by
  double-clicking or dragging onto the map canvas
* Run models by double-clicking or dragging onto the map canvas
* :guilabel:`Extract Symbols...` from QGIS Project files using the
  context menu
* Open files with their default applications
  (:guilabel:`Open <file type> Externally...` in the context menu).
  Examples: HTML files, spreadsheets, images, PDFs, text files, ...
* Copy entries 

Resource specific actions are listed for the different resource groups
sorted under the top-level entries listed below.
