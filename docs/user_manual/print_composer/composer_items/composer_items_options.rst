Layout Items Common Options
===========================

QGIS provides a large set of items to layout a map. They can be of map, legend,
scale bar, picture, table, north arrow, image type... They however share some
common options and behavior that are exposed below.

.. _create_layout_item:

Creating a layout item
----------------------

Items can be created using different tools, either from scratch or based on
existing items.

To create a layout item from scratch:

#. Select the corresponding tool either from the :menuselection:`Add Item` menu
   or the :guilabel:`Toolbox` bar.
#. Then:

   * Click on the page and fill the size and placement information requested
     in the :guilabel:`New Item Properties` dialog that pops up (for details,
     see :ref:`position_size`);

     .. _figure_layout_new_item:

     .. figure:: img/new_item_properties.png
        :align: center

        New Item properties dialog

   * Or click-and-drag to define the initial size and placement of the item.
     You can rely on :ref:`grids and guides <grid_guides>` snapping for a better
     position.

.. note::
  Because they can have particular shapes, drawing node or arrow items does not
  work with one-click nor click-and-drag methods; you need to click and
  place each node of the item. See :ref:`layout_node_based_shape_item` for more
  details.

You can also:

#. Select an existing item with the |select| :sup:`Select/Move item` button from
   the :guilabel:`Toolbox` toolbar
#. Use the contextual menu or the :menuselection:`Edit` menu tools to copy/cut
   the item and paste it at the mouse position as a new item.

   You can also use the :guilabel:`Paste in Place` (:kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+V`) command
   to duplicate an item from one page to another and place it in the new page at
   the same coordinates as the original.

Moreover, you can create items using a print layout template (for details, see
:ref:`layout_manager`) through the :menuselection:`Layout --> Add Items from
Template...` command.

.. tip:: **Add layout items using the file browser**

  From your file browser or using the :guilabel:`Browser` panel, drag-and-drop a
  print layout template (:file:`.qpt` file) onto a print layout dialog and QGIS
  automatically adds all items from that template to the layout.

.. _interact_layout_item:

Interacting with layout items
-----------------------------
Each item inside the print layout can be moved and resized to create a perfect
layout. For both operations the first step is to activate the |select|
:sup:`Select/Move item` tool and click on the item.

You can select multiple items with the |select| :sup:`Select/Move item` button:
click and drag over the items or hold the :kbd:`Shift` button and click on each
of the items you want.
To deselect an item, click on it holding the :kbd:`Shift` button.

Each time there's a selection, count of selected items is displayed on the
status bar.
Inside the :menuselection:`Edit` menu, you can find actions to select all the
items, clear all selections, invert the current selection and more...

.. _move_resize:

Moving and resizing items
.........................

Unless :menuselection:`View --> Show Bounding Boxes` option is unchecked, a
selected item will show squares on its boundaries ; moving one of them with
the mouse will resize the item in the corresponding direction. While resizing,
holding :kbd:`Shift` will maintain the aspect ratio. Holding :kbd:`Alt` will
resize from the item center.

To move a layout item, select it with the mouse and move while holding the left
button. If you need to constrain the movements to the horizontal or vertical
axis, just hold the :kbd:`Shift` button on the keyboard while moving the mouse.
You can also move a selected item using the :kbd:`Arrow keys` on the keyboard;
if the movement is too slow, you can speed it up by holding :kbd:`Shift`.
If you need better precision, use the :guilabel:`Position and size` properties,
or grid/guides snapping as explained above for item's creation.

Resizing or moving several items at once is made the same way as for a single
item. QGIS however provides some advanced tools to automatically resize a selection
of items following different rules:

* each item height matches the |resizeTallest| tallest or the |resizeShortest|
  shortest selected item;
* each item width matches the |resizeWidest| widest or the |resizeNarrowest|
  narrowest selected item;
* resizes items to |resizeSquare| squares: each item is enlarged to form a
  square.

Likewise, automated tools are available to organize multiple items position
by distributing equidistantly:

* edges (left, right, top or bottom) of items;
* centers of items either horizontally or vertically.

.. _group_items:

Grouping items
..............

Grouping items allows you to manipulate a set of items like a single one: you
can easily resize, move, delete, copy the items as a whole.

To create a group of items, select more than one and press the |groupItems|
:guilabel:`Group` button on the :menuselection:`View` menu or the
:guilabel:`Actions` toolbar or from the right-click menu. A row named ``Group``
is added to the :menuselection:`Items` panel and can be locked or hidden like
any other :ref:`Items panel's object <layout_items_panel>`.
Grouped items are **not individually** selectable on the canvas; use the Items panel
for direct selection and access the item's properties panel.

.. _lock_items:

Locking items
.............

Once you have found the correct position for an item, you can lock it by using
the |locked| :guilabel:`Lock selected items` button in the :menuselection:`Items`
menu or the :guilabel:`Actions` toolbar or ticking the box next
to the item in the :menuselection:`Items` panel. Locked items are **not**
selectable on the canvas.

Locked items can be unlocked by selecting the item in the :menuselection:`Items`
panel and unchecking the tickbox or you can use the icons on the toolbar.

.. index:: Items alignment
.. _align_items:

Alignment
.........

Raising or lowering the visual hierarchy for elements are inside the |raiseItems|
:sup:`Raise selected items` pull-down menu. Choose an element on the print layout
canvas and select the matching functionality to raise or lower the selected
element compared to the other elements. This order is
shown in the :menuselection:`Items` panel. You can also raise or lower objects
in the :menuselection:`Items` panel by clicking and dragging an object's label
in this list.

.. _figure_layout_common_align:

.. figure:: img/alignment_lines.png
   :align: center

   Alignment helper lines in the print layout

There are several alignment options available within the |alignLeft|
:sup:`Align selected items` pull-down menu (see figure_layout_common_align_).
To use an alignment function, you first select the elements and then click on
one of the alignment icons:

* |alignLeft| :guilabel:`Align Left` or |alignRight| :guilabel:`Align Right`;
* |alignTop| :guilabel:`Align Top` or |alignBottom| :guilabel:`Align Bottom`;
* |alignHCenter| :guilabel:`Align Center` horizontally or |alignVCenter|
  :guilabel:`Align Center Vertical`.

All selected elements will then be aligned to their
common bounding box. When moving items on the layout canvas, alignment helper
lines appear when borders, centers or corners are aligned.

.. _item_common_properties:

Items Common Properties
-----------------------

Layout items have a set of common properties you will find at the bottom of
the :guilabel:`Item Properties` panel: Position and size, Rotation, Frame,
Background, Item ID, Variables and Rendering (See figure_layout_common_).

.. _figure_layout_common:

.. figure:: img/common_properties.png
   :align: center

   Common Item Properties groups

.. note::

   The |dataDefined| :sup:`Data defined override` icon next to most of the
   options means that you can associate that property with a layer, features
   attributes, geometry or with any other layout item's property, using
   :ref:`expressions <vector_expressions>` or :ref:`variables
   <general_tools_variables>`. For more information see :ref:`data_defined`.

.. _Frame_Dialog:

* The :guilabel:`Position and size` group lets you define the size and position
  of the frame which contains the item (see :ref:`position_size` for more
  information).
* The :guilabel:`Rotation` sets the rotation of the element (in degrees).
* The |checkbox| :guilabel:`Frame` shows or hides the frame around the item.
  Use the :guilabel:`Color`, :guilabel:`Thickness` and :guilabel:`Join
  style` widgets to adjust those properties.
* Use the :guilabel:`Background color` menu for setting a background color.
  Click on the [Color...] button to display a dialog where you can pick a color
  or choose from a custom setting.
  Transparency can be adjusted through altering the alpha field settings.
* Use the :guilabel:`Item ID` to create a relationship to other print layout
  items. This is used with QGIS server and other potential web clients. You can
  set an ID on an item (for example, a map or a label), and then the web client
  can send data to set a property (e.g., label text) for that specific item.
  The GetProjectSettings command will list the items and IDs which are available
  in a layout.
* :guilabel:`Rendering` mode helps you set whether and how the item can be
  displayed: you can, for instance, apply :ref:`blending mode <blend-modes>`,
  adjust the opacity of the item or :guilabel:`Exclude item from exports`.

.. _position_size:

Position and Size
.................

Extending the features of the :ref:`New Item Properties <create_layout_item>`
dialog with data-defined capabilities, this group allows you to place the items
accurately.

.. _figure_layout_position:

.. figure:: img/position_size.png
   :align: center

   New Item properties dialog

* the actual number of the page to place the item on;
* the reference point of the item;
* the :guilabel:`X` and :guilabel:`Y` coordinates of the :guilabel:`Reference
  point` of the item on the chosen page. The ratio between these values can be
  locked by clicking on the |lockedGray| button. Changes made to a value using
  the widget or the |select| :sup:`Select/Move item` tool will
  be reflected in both of them;
* the :guilabel:`Width` and :guilabel:`Height` of the item bounding box. As
  for coordinates, the ratio between width and height can be locked.

.. index:: Rendering mode
.. _layout_Rendering_Mode:

Rendering mode
..............

QGIS allows advanced rendering for layout items just like vector and
raster layers.

.. _figure_layout_common_rendering:

.. figure:: img/rendering_mode.png
   :align: center

   Rendering mode

* :guilabel:`Blending mode`: With this tool you can achieve effects which would
  otherwise only be achieved using graphic rendering software. The pixels of
  your overlaying and underlaying items can be mixed according to the mode set
  (see :ref:`blend-modes` for description of each effect).
* :guilabel:`Transparency` |slider|: You can make the underlying item in the
  layout visible with this tool.
  Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your item to your needs.
  You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the
  menu beside the slider.
* |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude item from exports`: You can decide to make an
  item invisible in all exports.
  After activating this checkbox, the item will not be included in export to
  PDF, print etc..

Variables
.........

The :guilabel:`Variables` lists all the variables available at
the layout item's level (which includes all global, project and
composition's variables). Map items also include Map settings variables that
provide easy access to values like the map's scale, extent, and so on.

In :guilabel:`Variables`, it's also possible to manage item-level variables.
Click the |signPlus| button to add a new custom variable. Likewise, select any
custom item-level variable from the list and click the |signMinus| button to
remove it.

More information on variables usage in the :ref:`general_tools_variables` section.
