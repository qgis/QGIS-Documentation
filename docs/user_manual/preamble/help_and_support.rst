Mailing lists
=============

QGIS is under active development and as such it won't always work like
you expect it to. The preferred way to get help is by joining the
qgis-users mailing list. Your questions will reach a broader audience
and answers will benefit others.

QGIS Users
----------

This mailing list is used for discussion of QGIS in general, as well
as specific questions regarding its installation and use. You can
subscribe to the qgis-users mailing list by visiting the following
URL: https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user

QGIS Developers
---------------

If you are a developer facing problems of a more technical nature, you
may want to join the qgis-developer mailing list. This list is also a
place where people can chime in and collect and discuss QGIS
related UX (User Experience) / usability issues. It's here:
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-developer

QGIS Community Team
-------------------

This list deals with topics like documentation, context help, user
guide, web sites, blog, mailing lists, forums, and translation
efforts. If you would like to work on the user guide as well, this
list is a good starting point to ask your questions. You can subscribe
to this list at:
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team

QGIS Translations
-----------------

This list deals with the translation efforts. If you like to work on
the translation of the website, manuals or the graphical user interface (GUI),
this list is a good starting point to ask your questions. You can
subscribe to this list at:
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-tr

QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC)
-------------------------------------

This list is used to discuss Steering Committee issues related to
overall management and direction of QGIS. You can subscribe to this
list at: https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-psc

QGIS User groups
----------------

In order to locally promote QGIS and contribute to its development, some QGIS
communities are organized into QGIS User Groups. These groups are places to
discuss local topics, organize regional or national user meetings, organize
sponsoring of features... The list of current user groups is available at
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/usergroups.html


You are welcome to subscribe to any of the lists. Please remember to
contribute to the list by answering questions and sharing your
experiences.

IRC
===

We also maintain a presence on IRC - visit us by joining the #qgis
channel on irc.freenode.net. Please wait for a response to your
question, as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it
may take a while for them to notice your question. If you missed a
discussion on IRC, not a problem! We log all discussion, so you can
easily catch up. Just go to https://qgis.org/irclogs and read the
IRC-logs.

Commercial support for QGIS is also available. Check the website
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html for more information.

BugTracker
==========

While the qgis-users mailing list is useful for general 'How do I do
XYZ in QGIS?'-type questions, you may wish to notify us about bugs in
QGIS. You can submit bug reports using the
`QGIS bug tracker <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues>`_.

Please bear in mind that your bug may not always enjoy the priority
you might hope for (depending on its severity). Some bugs may require
significant developer effort to remedy, and the manpower is not always
available for this.

Feature requests can be submitted as well using the same ticket system
as for bugs. Please make sure to select the type ``Feature request``.

If you have found a bug and fixed it yourself, you can submit a
Pull Request on the `Github QGIS Project <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls>`_.

Read
`Bugs, Features and Issues <https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/bugreporting.html#bugs-features-and-issues>`_
and :ref:`submit_patch` for more details.

Blog
====

The QGIS community also runs a weblog at
https://planet.qgis.org/planet/, which has some interesting articles
for users and developers as well provided by other blogs in the
community. You are invited to contribute your own QGIS blog!

Plugins
=======

The website https://plugins.qgis.org provides the official QGIS plugins
web portal. Here, you find a list of all stable and experimental QGIS
plugins available via the 'Official QGIS Plugin Repository'.

Wiki
====

Lastly, we maintain a WIKI web site at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki where you can find a
variety of useful information relating to QGIS development, release
plans, links to download sites, message-translation hints and
more. Check it out, there are some goodies inside!
