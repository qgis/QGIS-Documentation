   Generic user workflow

HTTP(S) authentication
----------------------

One of the most common resource connections is via HTTP(S), e.g. web mapping
servers, and authentication method plugins often work for these types of
connections. Method plugins have access to the HTTP request object and can
manipulate both the request as well as its headers. This allows for many forms
of internet-based authentication. When connecting via HTTP(S) using the standard
username/password authentication method will attempt HTTP BASIC authentication
upon connection.

Database authentication
-----------------------

Connections to database resources are generally stored as ``key=value`` pairs,
which will expose usernames and (optionally) passwords, if *not* using an
authentication configuration. When configuring with the new auth system, the
``key=value`` will be an abstracted representation of the credentials, e.g.
``authfg=81t21b9``.

PKI authentication
------------------

When configuring PKI components within the authentication system, you have the
option of importing components into the database or referencing component files
stored on your filesystem. The latter may be useful if such components change
frequently, or where the components will be replaced by a system administrator.
In either instance you will need to store any passphrase needed to access
private keys within the database.

.. _figure_auth_pki_config:

.. figure:: img/auth-pki-config.png
   :align: center

   PKI configuration workflow

All PKI components can be managed in separate editors within the **Certificate
Manager**, which can be accessed in the :guilabel:`Authentication` tab in QGIS
`Options` dialog (:menuselection:`Settings --> Options`) by clicking the
:guilabel:`Manage Certificates` button.

.. _figure_auth_pki_certif:

.. figure:: img/auth-open-Certificate-manager.png
   :align: center

   Opening the Certificate Manager

In the :guilabel:`Certificate Manager`, there are editors for **Identities**,
**Servers** and **Authorities**. Each of these are contained in their own tabs,
and are described below in the order they are encountered in the workflow chart
above. The tab order is relative to frequently accessed editors once you are
accustomed to the workflow.

.. note::

   Because all authentication system edits write immediately to the
   authentication database, there is no need to click the :guilabel:`Options`
   dialog :guilabel:`OK` button for any changes to be saved. This is unlike other
   settings in the Options dialog.

Authorities
...........

You can manage available Certificate Authorities (CAs) from the **Authorities**
tab in the **Certificate manager** from the **Authentication** tab of
the QGIS **Options** dialog.

As referenced in the workflow chart above, the first step is to import or
reference a file of CAs. This step is optional, and may be unnecessary if your
PKI trust chain originates from root CAs already installed in your operating
system (OS), such as a certificate from a commercial certificate vendor. If your
authenticating root CA is not in the OS's trusted root CAs, it will need to be
imported or have its file system path referenced. (Contact your system
administrator if unsure.)

.. _figure_auth_pki_editor:

.. figure:: img/auth-editor-authorities.png
   :align: center

   Authorities editor

By default, the root CAs from your OS are available; however, their trust
settings are not inherited. You should review the certificate trust policy
settings, especially if your OS root CAs have had their policies adjusted. Any
certificate that is expired will be set to untrusted and will not be used in
secure server connections, unless you specifically override its trust policy. To
see the QGIS-discoverable trust chain for any certificate, select it and click
the |metadata| :sup:`Show information for certificate`.

.. _figure_auth_pki_info:

.. figure:: img/auth-authority-imported_cert-info-chain.png
   :align: center

   Certificate info dialog

You can edit the :guilabel:`Trust policy` |selectString| for any selected
certificate within the chain. Any change in trust policy to a selected
certificate will not be saved to the database unless the |fileSave|
:sup:`Save certificate trust policy change to database` button is clicked
*per* selected certification. Closing the dialog will **not** apply the
policy changes.

.. _figure_auth_pki_policy:

.. figure:: img/auth-authority-edit-trust_save-not-close.png
   :align: center

   Saving the trust policy changes

You can review the filtered CAs, both intermediate and root certificates, that
will be trusted for secure connections or change the default trust policy by
clicking the |transformSettings| **Options** button.

.. warning::
   Changing the default trust policy may result in problems with secure
   connections.

.. _figure_auth_pki_options:

.. figure:: img/auth-editor-authorities_utilities-menu.png
   :align: center

   Authorities options menu

You can import CAs or save a file system path from a file that contains multiple
CAs, or import individual CAs. The standard PEM format for files that contain
multiple CA chain certifications has the root cert at the bottom of the file and
all subsequently signed child certificates above, towards the beginning of the
file.

The CA certificate import dialog will find all CA certificates within the file,
regardless of order, and also offers the option to import certificates that are
considered invalid (in case you want to override their trust policy). You can
override the trust policy upon import, or do so later within the **Authorities**
editor.

.. _figure_auth_pki_import:

.. figure:: img/auth-authority-import.png
   :align: center

   Import certificates dialog

.. note::
   If you are pasting certificate information into the :guilabel:`PEM text`
   field, note that encrypted certificates are not supported.

Identities
..........

You can manage available client identity bundles from the :guilabel:`Identities`
tab in the :guilabel:`Certificate manager` from the **Authentication** tab of the
QGIS **Options** dialog. An identity is what authenticates you against a
PKI-enabled service and usually consists of a client certificate and
private key, either as separate files or combined into a single "bundled"
file. The bundle or private key is often passphrase-protected.

Once you have any Certificate Authorities (CAs) imported you can optionally
import any identity bundles into the authentication database. If you do not wish
to store the identities, you can reference their component file system paths
within an individual authentication configuration.

.. _figure_auth_pki_identities:

.. figure:: img/auth-editor-identities.png
   :align: center

   Identities editor

When importing an identity bundle, it can be passphrase-protected or
unprotected, and can contain CA certificates forming a trust chain. Trust chain
certifications will not be imported here; they can be added separately under the
:guilabel:`Authorities` tab.

Upon import the bundle's certificate and private key will be stored in the
database, with the key's storage encrypted using the QGIS master password.
Subsequent usage of the stored bundle from the database will only require input
of the master password.

Personal identity bundles consisting of PEM/DER (.pem/.der) and PKCS#12
(.p12/.pfx) components are supported. If a key or bundle is
passphrase-protected, the password will be required to validate the component
prior to import. Likewise, if the client certificate in the bundle is invalid
(for example, its effective date has not yet started or has elapsed) the bundle
can not be imported.

Handling bad layers
-------------------

Occasionally, the authentication configuration ID that is saved with a project
file is no longer valid, possibly because the current authentication database
is different than when the project was last saved, or due to a credentials
mismatch. In such cases the :guilabel:`Handle bad layers` dialog will be
presented upon QGIS launch.

.. _figure_auth_pki_badlayers:

.. figure:: img/auth-handle-bad-layers.png
   :align: center

   Handle bad layers with authentication

If a data source is found to have an authentication configuration ID associated
with it, you will be able to edit it. Doing so will automatically edit the data
source string, much in the same way as opening the project file in a text editor
and editing the string.

.. _figure_auth_pki_badlayers_edit:

.. figure:: img/auth-handle-bad-layers-edit.png
   :align: center

   Edit bad layer's authentication config ID

Changing authentication config ID
---------------------------------

Occasionally, you will need to change the authentication configuration ID that
is associated with accessing a resource. There are instances where this is
useful:

* **Resource auth config ID is no longer valid**: This can occur when you have
  switched auth databases add need to *align* a new configuration to the ID
  already associated with a resource.
* **Shared project files**: If you intended to share projects between users, e.g.
  via a shared file server, you can *predefine* a 7-character (containing
  **a-z** and/or **0-9**) that is associated with the resource. Then, individual
  users change the ID of an authentication configuration that is specific to
  their credentials of the resource. When the project is opened, the ID is found
  in the authentication database, but the credentials are different per user.

.. _figure_auth_id:

.. figure:: img/auth-change-config-id.png
   :align: center

   Changing a layer's authentication config ID (unlocked yellow text field)


.. warning::
   Changing the auth config ID is considered an advanced operation and should
   only be done with full knowledge as to why it is necessary. This is why there
   is a lock button that needs clicked, to unlock the ID's text field prior to
   editing the ID.

QGIS Server support
-------------------

When using a project file, with layers that have authentication configurations,
as a basis for a map in QGIS Server, there are a couple of additional setup
steps necessary for QGIS to load the resources:

* Authentication database needs to be available
* Authentication database's master password needs to be available

When instantiating the authentication system, Server will create or use
:file:`qgis-auth.db` in :file:`~/.qgis2/` or the directory defined by the
``QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH`` environment variable. It may be that the Server's user
has no HOME directory, in which case, use the environment variable to define a
directory that the Server's user has read/write permissions and is not located
within the web-accessible directories.

To pass the master password to Server, write it to the first line of file at a
path on the file system readable by the Server processes user and defined using
the ``QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE`` environment variable. Ensure to limit the file
as only readable by the Server's process user and to not store the file within
web-accessible directories.

.. note::

   ``QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE`` variable will be removed from the Server
   environment immediately after accessing.

SSL server exceptions
---------------------

.. _figure_auth_server:

.. figure:: img/auth-ssl-config.png
   :align: center

   SSL server exception

You can manage SSL server configurations and exceptions from the **Servers** tab
in the **Authentication** section of the QGIS **Options** dialog.

Sometimes, when connecting to an SSL server, there are errors with the SSL
"handshake" or the server's certificate. You can ignore those errors or create
an SSL server configuration as an exception. This is similar to how web browsers
allow you to override SSL errors, but with more granular control.

.. warning::
   You should not create an SSL server configuration unless you have complete
   knowledge of the entire SSL setup between the server and client. Instead,
   report the issue to the server administrator.

.. note::
   Some PKI setups use a completely different CA trust chain to validate client
   identities than the chain used to validate the SSL server certificate. In
   such circumstances, any configuration created for the connecting server will
   not necessarily fix an issue with the validation of your client identity, and
   only your client identity's issuer or server administrator can fix the issue.

You can pre-configure an SSL server configuration by clicking the |signPlus|
button. Alternatively, you can add a configuration when an SSL error occurs
during a connection and you are presented with an **SSL Error** dialog (where
the error can be ignored temporarily or saved to the database and ignored):

.. _figure_auth_server_config:

   :align: center

   Manually adding configuration

.. _figure_auth_server_error:

.. figure:: img/auth-server-error-add-exception.png

   Adding configuration during SSL error

Once an SSL configuration is saved to the database, it can be edited or deleted.

.. _figure_auth_server_ssl:

.. figure:: img/auth-editor-servers.png
   :align: center

   Existing SSL configuration

.. _figure_auth_server_ssledit:

.. figure:: img/auth-server-edit.png
   :align: center

   Editing an existing SSL configuration

If you want to pre-configure an SSL configuration and the import dialog is not
working for your server's connection, you can manually trigger a connection via
the **Python Console** by running the following code (replace
``https://bugreports.qt-project.org`` with the URL of your server):

.. testcode:: auth_workflows

   from qgis.PyQt.QtNetwork import QNetworkRequest
   from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QUrl
   from qgis.core import QgsNetworkAccessManager

   req = QNetworkRequest(QUrl('https://bugreports.qt-project.org'))
   reply = QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance().get(req)

This will open an SSL error dialog if any errors occur, where you can choose to
save the configuration to the database.
