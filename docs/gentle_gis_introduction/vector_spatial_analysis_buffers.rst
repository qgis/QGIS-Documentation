Overview
========

**Spatial analysis** uses spatial information to extract new and additional
meaning from GIS data. Usually spatial analysis is carried out using a GIS
Application. GIS Applications normally have spatial analysis tools for feature
statistics (e.g. how many vertices make up this polyline?) or geoprocessing such
as feature buffering. The types of spatial analysis that are used vary according
to subject areas. People working in water management and research (hydrology)
will most likely be interested in analysing terrain and modelling water as it
moves across it. In wildlife management users are interested in analytical
functions that deal with wildlife point locations and their relationship to the
environment. In this topic we will discuss buffering as an example of a useful
spatial analysis that can be carried out with vector data.

Buffering in detail
===================

**Buffering** usually creates two areas: one area that is **within** a specified
distance to selected real world features and the other area that is **beyond**.
The area that is within the specified distance is called the **buffer zone**.

A **buffer zone** is any area that serves the purpose of keeping real world
features distant from one another. Buffer zones are often set up to protect the
environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents
or natural disasters, or to prevent violence. Common types of buffer zones may
be greenbelts between residential and commercial areas, border zones between
countries (see figure_buffer_zone_), noise protection zones around airports, or
pollution protection zones along rivers.

   buffer zone. (Photo taken by SGT Jim Greenhill 2006).

In a GIS Application, **buffer zones are** always represented as **vector
polygons** enclosing other polygon, line or point features (see
figure_point_buffer_, figure_line_buffer_, ).

Variations in buffering
=======================

There are several variations in buffering. The **buffer distance** or buffer size
**can vary** according to numerical values provided in the vector layer attribute
table for each feature. The numerical values have to be defined in map units
according to the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) used with the data. For example,
the width of a buffer zone along the banks of a river can vary depending on the
intensity of the adjacent land use. For intensive cultivation the buffer distance
may be bigger than for organic farming (see Figure figure_variable_buffer_ and
Table table_buffer_attributes_).

Buffers around polyline features, such as rivers or roads, do not have to be on
both sides of the lines. They can be on either the left side or the right side
of the line feature. In these cases the left or right side is determined by the
direction from the starting point to the end point of line during digitising.

Multiple buffer zones
---------------------

A feature can also have more than one buffer zone. A nuclear power plant may be
buffered with distances of 10, 15, 25 and 30 km, thus forming multiple rings
around the plant as part of an evacuation plan (see figure_multiple_buffers_).

   Buffering a point feature with distances of 10, 15, 25 and 30 km.

Buffering with intact or dissolved boundaries
---------------------------------------------

Buffer zones often have dissolved boundaries so that there are no overlapping
areas between the buffer zones. In some cases though, it may also be useful for
boundaries of buffer zones to remain intact, so that each buffer zone is a
separate polygon and you can identify the overlapping areas (see
Figure figure_buffer_dissolve_).

.. _figure_buffer_dissolve:

.. figure:: img/buffer_dissolve.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Buffer zones with dissolved (left) and with intact boundaries (right) showing
   overlapping areas.

Buffering outward and inward
----------------------------

Buffer zones around polygon features are usually extended outward from a polygon
boundary but it is also possible to create a buffer zone inward from a polygon
boundary. Say, for example, the Department of Tourism wants to plan a new road
around Robben Island and environmental laws require that the road is at least
200 meters inward from the coast line. They could use an inward buffer to find
the 200 m line inland and then plan their road not to go beyond that line.

Common problems / things to be aware of
=======================================

Most GIS Applications offer buffer creation as an analysis tool, but the options
for creating buffers can vary. For example, not all GIS Applications allow you
to buffer on either the left side or the right side of a line feature, to dissolve
the boundaries of buffer zones or to buffer inward from a polygon boundary.

A buffer distance always has to be defined as a whole number (integer) or a
decimal number (floating point value). This value is defined in map units (meters,
feet, decimal degrees) according to the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the
vector layer.

More spatial analysis tools
===========================

Buffering is a an important and often used spatial analysis tool but there are
many others that can be used in a GIS and explored by the user.

**Spatial overlay** is a process that allows you to identify the relationships
between two polygon features that share all or part of the same area. The output
vector layer is a combination of the input features information (see
figure_overlay_operations_).

.. _figure_overlay_operations:

.. figure:: img/overlay_operations.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Spatial overlay with two input vector layers (a_input = rectangle, b_input =
   circle). The resulting vector layer is displayed green.

Typical spatial overlay examples are:

* **Intersection**: The output layer contains all areas where both layers overlap
  (intersect).
* **Union**: the output layer contains all areas of the two input layers combined.
* **Symmetrical difference**: The output layer contains all areas of the input
  layers except those areas where the two layers overlap (intersect).
* **Difference**: The output layer contains all areas of the first input layer
  that do not overlap (intersect) with the second input layer.

What have we learned?
=====================

Let's wrap up what we covered in this worksheet:

* **Buffer zones** describe areas around real world features.
* Buffer zones are always **vector polygons**.
* A feature can have **multiple** buffer zones.
* The size of a buffer zone is defined by a **buffer distance**.
* A buffer distance has to be an **integer** or **floating point** value.
* A buffer distance can be different for each feature within a vector layer.
* Polygons can be buffered **inward** or **outward** from the polygon boundary.
* Buffer zones can be created with **intact** or **dissolved** boundaries.
* Besides buffering, a GIS usually provides a variety of vector analysis tools
  to solve spatial tasks.

Now you try!
============

Here are some ideas for you to try with your learners:

* Because of dramatic traffic increase, the town planners want to widen the main
  road and add a second lane. Create a buffer around the road to find properties
  that fall within the buffer zone (see figure_buffer_road_).
* For controlling protesting groups, the police want to establish a neutral zone
  to keep protesters at least 100 meters from a building. Create a buffer around
  a building and colour it so that event planners can see where the buffer area
  is.
* A truck factory plans to expand. The siting criteria stipulate that a potential
  site must be within 1 km of a heavy-duty road. Create a buffer along a main
  road so that you can see where potential sites are.
* Imagine that the city wants to introduce a law stipulating that no bottle stores
  may be within a 1000 meter buffer zone of a school or a church. Create a 1 km
  buffer around your school and then go and see if there would be any bottle
  stores too close to your school.

.. _figure_buffer_road:

.. figure:: img/buffer_road.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Buffer zone (green) around a roads map (brown). You can see which houses fall
   within the buffer zone, so now you could contact the owner and talk to him
   about the situation.

Something to think about
========================

If you don't have a computer available, you can use a toposheet and a compass to
create buffer zones around buildings. Make small pencil marks at equal distance
all along your feature using the compass, then connect the marks using a ruler!
