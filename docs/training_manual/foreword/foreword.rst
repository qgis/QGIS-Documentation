Foreword
========
Welcome to our course!
We will be showing you how to use QGIS easily and efficiently.
If you are new to GIS, we will tell you what you need to get started.
If you are an experienced user, you will see how QGIS fulfills all the
functions you expect from a GIS program, and more!

Why QGIS?
---------
As information becomes increasingly spatially aware, there is no shortage of
tools able to fulfill some or all commonly used GIS functions. Why should
anyone be using QGIS over some other GIS software package?

Here are only some of the reasons:

- *It's free, as in lunch.* Installing and using the QGIS program costs you a
  grand total of zero money. No initial fee, no recurring fee, nothing.

- *It's free, as in liberty.* If you need extra functionality in QGIS, you
  can do more than just hope it will be included in the next release. You can
  sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are
  familiar with programming. 

- *It's constantly developing.* Because anyone can add new features and improve
  on existing ones, QGIS never stagnates. The development of a new tool can
  happen as quickly as you need it to.

- *Extensive help and documentation is available.* If you're stuck with
  anything, you can turn to the extensive documentation, your fellow QGIS
  users, or even the developers.

- *Cross-platform.* QGIS can be installed on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Now that you know why you want to use QGIS, these exercises will make you
know how.

Background
----------
In 2008 we launched the :ref:`Gentle Introduction to GIS
<gentle_introduction_gis>`, a completely free, open content resource for
people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon and new
terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and has been a
phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to us to tell us how
they are using the materials to run University Training Courses, teach
themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software tutorial,
but rather aims to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all examples)
for someone learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual which provides a
detailed functional overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not
structured as a tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti
Consulting CC. we frequently run training courses and have realised that a
third resource is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through
learning the key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted
us to produce this work.

This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to run a 5
day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured with
content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has many
exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text.

This work is by no means a complete treatise on all the things you can do with
QGIS and we encourage others to add new materials to fill any gaps. Linfiniti
Consulting CC. can also create additional materials for you as a commercial
service, with the understanding that all such works produced should become part
of the core content and be published under the same license.
