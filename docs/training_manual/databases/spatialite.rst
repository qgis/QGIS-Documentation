|LS| Working with SpatiaLite databases in QGIS
======================================================================
While PostGIS is generally used on a server to provide spatial
database capabilities to multiple users at the same time, QGIS also
supports the use of a file format called *SpatiaLite* that is a
lightweight, portable way to store an entire spatial database in a
single file.
Obviously, these 2 types of spatial databases should be used for
different purposes, but the same basic principles and techniques apply
to both.
Let's create a new SpatiaLite database and explore the functionality
provided to work with these databases in QGIS.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn how to interact with
SpatiaLite databases using the QGIS Browser interface.

|basic| |FA| Creating a SpatiaLite database with the Browser
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Browser panel, we can create a new SpatiaLite database and
get it setup for use in QGIS.

#. Right click on the :guilabel:`SpatiaLite` entry in the Browser tree
   and select :guilabel:`Create Database`.
#. Specify where on your filesystem you want to store the file and
   name it ``qgis-sl.db``.
#. Again right click on the :guilabel:`SpatiaLite` entry in the Browser
   tree and now select the :guilabel:`New Connection` item.
   Find the file you created in the last step and open it.

Now that you have configured your new database you will find that the
entry in Browser tree has nothing underneath it and the only thing you
can do at this point is to delete the connection.
This is of course because we haven't added any tables to this database.
Let's go ahead and do that.

#. Find the button to create a new layer and use the dropdown to
   create a new SpatiaLite layer, or select
   :menuselection:`Layer --> New -->` |newSpatiaLiteLayer|
   :menuselection:`New SpatiaLite Layer`.
#. Select the database we created in the previous steps in the drop
   down.
#. Give the layer the name ``places``.
#. Tick the checkbox next to
   :guilabel:`Create an auto-incrementing primary key`.
#. Add two attributes as shown in below
#. Click :guilabel:`OK` to create the table.

   .. figure:: img/new_layer_setup.png
      :align: center

#. Click the refresh button at the top of the Browser and you should
   now see your ``places`` table listed.

   .. figure:: img/new_layer_added.png
      :align: center

   You can right click on the table and view its properties as we
   did in the previous exercise.

From here you can start an editing session and start adding data to
your new database directly.

We also learned about how to import data into a database using the
DB Manager and you can use this same technique to import data into
your new SpatiaLite DB.

You have seen how to create SpatiaLite databases, add tables to
them and use these tables as layers in QGIS.


.. Substitutions definitions - AVOID EDITING PAST THIS LINE
   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
   source folder.
