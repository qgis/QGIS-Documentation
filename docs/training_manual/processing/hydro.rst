Hydrological analysis
============================================================


.. note:: In this lesson we will perform some hydrological analysis.
  This analysis will be used in some of the following lessons, as it constitutes
  a very good example of an analysis workflow, and we will use it to demonstrate
  some advanced features.

In this lesson, we are going to do some hydrological analysis. Starting with a DEM,
we are going to extract a channel network, delineate watersheds and calculate some statistics. 

The first thing is to load the project with the lesson data, which just contains a DEM.

.. figure:: img/hydro/dem.png

The first module to execute is *Catchment area* (in some SAGA versions it is called
*Flow accumulation (Top Down)*). You can use anyone of  the others named *Catchment area*.
They have different algorithms underneath, but the results are basically the same.

Select the DEM in the *Elevation* field, and leave the default values for the rest of parameters.

.. figure:: img/hydro/catchmentarea.png

Some algorithms calculate many layers, but the *Catchment Area* one is the only one we will be using.

You can get rid of the other ones if you want.

The rendering of the layer is not very informative. 

.. figure:: img/hydro/catchmentlayer.png

To know why, you can have a look at the histogram and you will see that value
are not evenly distributed (there are a few cells with very high value, those
corresponding to the channel network). Calculating the logarithm of the catchment
area value yields a layer that conveys much more information (you can do it using
the raster calculator).

.. figure:: img/hydro/catchmentlayerlog.png

The catchment area (also known as flow accumulation), can be used to set a
threshold for channel initiation. This can be done using the *Channel network* algorithm.
Here is how you have to set it up (note the *Initiation threshold* *Greater than* 10.000.000).

.. figure:: img/hydro/channelnetwork.png 


Use the original catchment area layer, not the logarithm one.
That one was just for rendering purposes.

If you increase the *Initiation threshold* value, you will get a more sparse
channel network. If you decrease it, you will get a denser one.
With the proposed value, this is what you get.

The image above shows just the resulting vector layer and the DEM, but there
should be also a raster one with the same channel network. That raster one
will be, in fact, the one we will be using.

Now, we will use the *Watersheds basins* algorithm to delineate the subbasins
corresponding to that channel network, using as outlet points all the junctions
in it. Here is how you have to set the corresponding parameters dialog.

And this is what you will get.

This is a raster result. You can vectorise it using the *Vectorising grid classes* algorithm.

Now, let's try to compute statistics about the elevation values in one of the
subbasins. The idea is to have a layer that just represents the elevation
within that subbasin and then pass it to the module that calculates those statistics.

First, let's clip the original DEM with the polygon representing a subbasin.
We will use the *Clip raster with polygon* algorithm. If we select a single
subbasin polygon and then call the clipping algorithm, we can clip the DEM to
the area covered by that polygon, since the algorithm is aware of the selection.

Select a polygon,

.. figure:: img/hydro/selectedpolygon.png 

and call the clipping algorithm with the following parameters:

.. figure:: img/hydro/clipgrid.png 

The element selected in the input field is, or course, the DEM we want to clip.

You will get something like this.

.. figure:: img/hydro/clippeddem.png 

This layer is ready to be used in the *Raster layer statistics* algorithm.

.. figure:: img/hydro/rasterstats.png 

The resulting statistics are the following ones.

.. figure:: img/hydro/stats.png 

We will use both the basin calculations procedure and the statistics
calculation in other lessons, to find out how other elements can help us
automate both of them and work more effectively.
