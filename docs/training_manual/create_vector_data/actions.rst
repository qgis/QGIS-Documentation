|LS| Actions
===============================================================================

Now that you've seen a default action in the previous lesson, it's time to
define your own actions. An action is something that happens when you click on
a feature. It can add a lot of extra functionality to your map, allowing you to
retrieve additional information about an object, for example. Assigning actions
can add a whole new dimension to your map!

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn how to add custom actions.


|basic| |FA| Open an Image
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`school_property` layer you created previously. The course
materials include photos of each of the three properties you digitized. What
we're going to do next is to associate each property with its image. Then we'll
create an action that will open the image for a property when clicking on the
property.

|basic| |FA| Add a Field for Images
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`school_property` layer has no way to associate an image with a
property yet. First we'll create a field for this purpose.

* Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog.
* Click on the :guilabel:`Fields` tab.
* Toggle editing mode:

.. figure:: img/toggle_editing_mode.png
   :align: center

* Add a new column:

.. figure:: img/add_new_column.png
   :align: center

* Enter the values below:

.. figure:: img/column_settings.png
   :align: center

* After the field has been created, click on the :guilabel:`Line edit` button
  next to the new field.
* Set it up for a :guilabel:`File name`:

.. figure:: img/select_file_name.png
   :align: center

* Click :guilabel:`OK` on the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog.
* Use the :guilabel:`Identify` tool to click on one of the three features in
  the :guilabel:`school_property` layer.

Since you're still in edit mode, the dialog should be active and look like
this:

.. figure:: img/school_property_no_image.png
   :align: center

* Click on the browse button (the :guilabel:`...` next to the :guilabel:`image`
  field).
* Select the path for your image. The images are in
  :kbd:`exercise_data/school_property_photos/` and are named the same as the
  features they should be associated with.
* Click :guilabel:`OK`.
* Associate all of the images with the correct features using this method.
* Save your edits and exit edit mode.


|basic| |FA| Creating an Action
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Open the :guilabel:`Actions` form for the :guilabel:`school_property` layer.
* In the :kbd:`Action properties` panel, enter the words :kbd:`Show Image` into
  the :guilabel:`Name` field:

.. figure:: img/show_image_action.png
   :align: center

What to do next varies according to your operating system, so choose the
appropriate course to follow:


Windows
...............................................................................

* Click on the :guilabel:`Type` dropdown and choose :guilabel:`Open`.


Ubuntu Linux
...............................................................................

* Under :guilabel:`Action`, write :kbd:`eog` for the *Gnome Image Viewer*, or
  write :kbd:`display` to use *ImageMagick*. Remember to put a space after the
  command!


MacOS
...............................................................................

* Click on the :guilabel:`Type` dropdown and choose :guilabel:`Mac`.
* Under :guilabel:`Action`, write :kbd:`open`. Remember to put a space after
  the command!


Continue writing the command
...............................................................................

You want to open the image, and QGIS knows where the
image is. All it needs to do is to tell the :guilabel:`Action` where the image
is.

* Select :guilabel:`image` from the list:

.. figure:: img/select_image.png
   :align: center

* Click the :guilabel:`Insert field` button. QGIS will add the phrase :kbd:`[%
  "image" %]` in the :guilabel:`Action` field.
* Click the :guilabel:`Add to action list` button.
* Click :guilabel:`OK` on the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog.

Now we will test the new Action:

* Click on the :guilabel:`school_property` layer in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel
  so that it is highlighted.
* Find the :guilabel:`Run feature action` button (on the same toolbar as the
  :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table` button):

  |actionRun|

* Click on the down arrow to the right of this button. There's only one action
  defined for this layer so far, which is the one you just created.
* Click the button itself to activate the tool.
* Using this tool, click on any of the three school properties.
* The image for that property will now open.

|moderate| |FA| Searching the Internet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say we're looking at the map and want to know more about the area that a
farm is in. Suppose you know nothing of the area in question and want to find
general information about it. Your first impulse, considering that you're using
a computer right now, would probably be to Google the name of the area. So
let's tell QGIS to do that automatically for us!

* Open the attribute table for the :guilabel:`landuse` layer.

We'll be using the :kbd:`name` field for each of our landuse areas to search
Google.

* Close the attribute table.
* Go back to :guilabel:`Actions` in :guilabel:`Layer Properties`.
* In the field :menuselection:`Action Properties --> Name`, write :kbd:`Google
  Search`.

What to do next varies according to your operating system, so choose the
appropriate course to follow:

Windows
...............................................................................

* Under :guilabel:`Type`, choose :guilabel:`Open`. This will tell Windows to
  open an Internet address in your default browser, such as Internet Explorer.

Ubuntu Linux
...............................................................................

* Under :guilabel:`Action`, write :kbd:`xdg-open`. This will tell Ubuntu to
  open an Internet address in your default browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.

MacOS
...............................................................................

* Under :guilabel:`Action`, write :kbd:`open`. This will tell MacOS to open an
  Internet address in your default browser, such as Safari.

Continue writing the command
...............................................................................

Whichever command you used above, you need to tell it which Internet address to
open next. You want it to visit Google, and to search for a phrase
automatically.

Usually when you use Google, you enter your search phrase into the Google
Search bar. But in this case, you want your computer to do this for you. The
way you tell Google to search for something (if you don't want to use its
search bar directly) is by giving your Internet browser the address
``https://www.google.com/search?q=SEARCH_PHRASE``, where
``SEARCH_PHRASE`` is what you want to search for. Since we don't know what
phrase to search for yet, we'll just enter the first part (without the search
phrase).

* In the :guilabel:`Action` field, write
  ``https://www.google.com/search?q=``. Remember to add a space after your
  initial command before writing this in!

Now you want QGIS to tell the browser to tell Google to search for the value of
:kbd:`name` for any feature that you could click on.

* Select the :guilabel:`name` field.
* Click :guilabel:`Insert field`:

.. figure:: img/google_search_action.png
   :align: center

This will tell QGIS to add the phrase next:

.. figure:: img/google_search_entry.png
   :align: center

What this means is that QGIS is going to open the browser and send it to the
address ``https://www.google.com/search?q=[% "name" %]``. But :kbd:`[%
"name" %]` tells QGIS to use the contents of the :kbd:`name` field as the
phrase to search for.

So if, for example, the landuse area you click on is named
``Marloth Nature Reserve``, then QGIS is going to send the browser to
``https://www.google.com/search?q=Marloth%20Nature%20Reserve``, which will
cause your browser to visit Google, which will in turn search for
"Marloth Nature Reserve".

* If you haven't done so already, set everything up as explained above.
* Click the :guilabel:`Add to action list` button. The new action will appear
  in the list above.
* Click :guilabel:`OK` on the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog.

Now to test the new action.

* With the :guilabel:`landuse` layer active in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel, click
  on the :guilabel:`Run feature action` button.
* Click on any landuse area you can see on the map. Your browser will now open, and
  will automatically start a Google search for the town that is recorded as
  that area's :kbd:`name` value.

.. note::  If your action doesn't work, check that everything was entered
   correctly; typos are common with this kind of work!

|hard| |FA| Open a Webpage Directly in QGIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above, you've seen how to open a webpage in an external browser. There are some
shortcomings with this approach in that it adds an unknowable dependency â€“ will
the end-user have the software required to execute the action on their system?
As you've seen, they don't necessarily even have the same kind of base command
for the same kind of action, if you don't know which OS they'll be using. With
some OS versions, the above commands to open the browser might not work at all.
This could be an insurmountable problem.

However, QGIS sits on top of the incredibly powerful and versatile Qt4 library.
Also, QGIS actions can be arbitrary, tokenized (i.e. using variable information
based on the contents of a field attribute) Python commands!

Now you'll see how to use a python action to show a web page. It's the same
general idea as opening a site in an external browser, but it requires no
browser on the userâ€™s system since it uses the Qt4 QWebView class (which is a
webkit based html widget) to display the content in a pop up window.

Instead of Google, let's use Wikipedia this time. So the URL you request will
look like this:

``https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SEARCH_PHRASE``

To create the layer action:

* Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog and head over to the
  :guilabel:`Actions` tab.
* Set up a new action using the following properties for the action:

  * :guilabel:`Type`: :kbd:`Python`
  * :guilabel:`Name`: :kbd:`Wikipedia`
  * :guilabel:`Action` (all on one line)::

     from PyQt4.QtCore import QUrl; from PyQt4.QtWebKit import QWebView;  myWV = QWebView(None); myWV.load(QUrl('https://wikipedia.org/wiki/[% "name" %]')); myWV.show()

.. figure:: img/python_action_example.png
   :align: center

There are a couple of things going on here:

* All the python code is in a single line with semi-colons separating commands
  (instead of newlines, the usual way of separating Python commands).
* :kbd:`[% "name" %]` will be replaced by the actual attribute value when
  the action is invoked (as before).
* The code simply creates a new :kbd:`QWebView` instance, sets its URL, and
  then calls :kbd:`show()` on it to make it visible as a window on the userâ€™s
  desktop.

Note that this is a somewhat contrived example. Python works with semantically
significant indentation, so separating things with semicolons isn't the best
way to write it. So, in the real world, you'd be more likely to import your
logic from a Python module and then call a function with a field attribute as
parameter.

You could equally use the approach to display an image without requiring that
the user has a particular image viewer on their system.

* Try using the methods described above to load a Wikipedia page using the
  Wikipedia action you just created.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actions allow you to give your map extra functionality, useful to the end-user
who views the same map in QGIS. Due to the fact that you can use shell commands
for any operating system, as well as Python, the sky's the limit in terms of
the functions you could incorporate!

Now that you've done all kinds of vector data creation, you'll learn how to
analyze this data to solve problems. That's the topic of the next module.
