Documentation Guidelines
========================

QGIS Documentation will be built automatically on the server at 0, 8am, 4pm
US/Pacific (Pacific Time). The current status is available at
https://docs.qgis.org.

QGIS Documentation source files are available at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation.
They are mainly written using the reStructuredText (reST) format syntax, coupled
with some scripts from the Sphinx toolset to post-process the HTML output.
For general information on these tools, see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html or
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html.

The following chapters will guide you through learning:

* how to manage the documentation source files using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
  system and the `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ platform on which they are stored
* how to modify the texts, provide screenshots... in a compliant way
* how to share and ensure your modifications are pushed to the official docs.

If you are looking for general information about how to contribute to the QGIS
project, you may find help at `Get Involved in the QGIS Community
<https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/index.html>`_.
