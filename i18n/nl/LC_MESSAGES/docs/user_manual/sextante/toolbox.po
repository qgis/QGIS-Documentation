":guilabel:`Use filename as layer name`. The name of each resulting layer "
"created by SEXTANTE is defined by the algorithm generating it. In some "
"cases, a fixed name might be used, that meaning that the same name will be "
"used, no matter which input layer is used. In other cases, the name might "
