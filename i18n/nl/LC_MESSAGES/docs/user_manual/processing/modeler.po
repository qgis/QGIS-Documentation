"The *graphical modeler* allows to create complex models using a simple and "
"easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis operations are"
" not isolated, but part of a chain of operations instead. Using the "
"graphical modeler, that chain of processes can be wrapped into a single "
"process, so it is easier and more convenient to execute than a single "
"process later on a different set on inputs. No matter how many steps and "
"different algorithms it involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm,"
" thus saving time and effort, specially for larger models."
