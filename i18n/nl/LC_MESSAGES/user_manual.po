"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
"anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the "
"world. It is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in "
"boats and by hikers.  The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites "
"to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation.  Most "
"receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
"*waypoints*), sequences of locations that make up a planned *route* and a "
"tracklog or *track* of the receivers movement over time.  Waypoints, routes "
"and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data.  QGIS displays "
