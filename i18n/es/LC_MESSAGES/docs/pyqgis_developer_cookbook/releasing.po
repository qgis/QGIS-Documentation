En esa página encontrará guías de empaquetado del complemento para que éste funcione correctamente con el instalador de complementos. O en el caso de que usted quiera configurar su propio repositiorio de complementos, cree un archivo XML para listar los complementos y sus metadatos. Para ver ejemplos mire otros `repositorios de complementos <http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Python_Plugin_Repositories>`_. "
