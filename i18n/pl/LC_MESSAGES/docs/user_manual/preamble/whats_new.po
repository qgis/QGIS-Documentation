#~ msgid "What's new in QGIS |CURRENT|"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As "
#~ "such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over "
#~ "QGIS 1.8.0. We recommend that you use this version over previous releases."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**New icon theme**: We have updated our icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme "
#~ "introducing an improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS"
#~ " user interface."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Soft notifications**: In many cases we want to tell you something, but we "
#~ "don't want to stop your work or get in your way. With the new notification "
#~ "system QGIS can let you know about important information via a message bar "
#~ "(colour depends on the importance of the message) that appears at the top of"
#~ " the map canvas but doesn't force you to deal with it if you are busy doing "
#~ "something else. Programmers can create these notification (e.g. from a "
#~ "plugin) too using our python API."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Application custom font and Qt stylesheet**: The system font used for the "
#~ "application's user interface can now be set. Any C++ or Python plugin that "
#~ "is a child of the QGIS GUI application or has copied/applied the "
#~ "application's GUI stylesheet can inherit its styling, which is useful for "
#~ "GUI fixes across platforms and when using custom QGIS Qt widgets, like "
#~ "QgsCollapsibleGroupBox."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Live color chooser dialogs and buttons**: Every color chooser button "
#~ "throughout the interface has been updated to give visual feedback on whether"
#~ " the current color has a transparent, or 'alpha,' component. The color "
#~ "chooser opened by the new color buttons will now always be the default for "
#~ "the operating system. If the user has Use live-updating color chooser "
#~ "dialogs checked under Options -> General -> Application, any change in the "
#~ "color chooser will immediately be shown in the color button and for any item"
#~ " currently being edited, where applicable."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**SVG Annotations**: With QGIS 2.0 you can now add SVG annotations to your "
#~ "map - either pinned to a specific place or in a relative position over the "
#~ "map canvas."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Oracle Spatial support**: QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Web Coverage Service provider added**: QGIS now provides native support "
#~ "for Web Coverage Service layers - the process for adding WCS is similar to "
#~ "adding a WMS layer or WFS layer."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Raster Data Provider overhaul**: The raster data provider system has been "
#~ "completely overhauled. One of the best new features stemming from this work "
#~ "is the ability to 'Layer -> Save As...' to save any raster layer as a new "
#~ "layer. In the process you can clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a "
#~ "new Coordinate Reference System. You can also save a raster layer as a "
#~ "rendered image so if you for example have single band raster that you have "
#~ "applied a colour palette to, you can save the rendered layer out to a "
#~ "georeferenced RGB layer."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Raster 2% cumulative cut by default**: Many raster imagery products have a"
#~ " large number of outliers which result in images having a washed out "
#~ "appearance. QGIS 2.0 intoduces much more fine grained control over the "
#~ "rendering behaviour of rasters, including using a 2% - 98% percent "
#~ "cumulative cut by default when determining the colour space for the image. "
#~ "The image here shows QGIS 1.8 (left) versus QGIS 2.0 (right) when rendering "
#~ "the same image with default settings."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**WMTS Support**: The WMS client in QGIS now supports WMTS (Web Mapping Tile"
#~ " Service) including selection of sub-datasets such as time slices. When "
#~ "adding a WMS layer from a compliant server, you will be prompted to select "
#~ "the time slice to display."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Support for transparency in colour definitions**: In most places where you"
#~ " select colours, QGIS now allows you to specify the alpha channel (which "
#~ "determins how transparent the colour should be). This allows you to create "
#~ "great looking maps and to hide data easily that you don't want users to see."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Color Control for Raster Layers**: QGIS 2.0 allows you to precisely "
#~ "control exactly how you'd like raster layers to appear. You now have "
#~ "complete control over the brightness, contrast and saturation of raster "
#~ "layers. There's even options to allow display of rasters in grayscale or by "
#~ "colorising with a specified color."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Colour ramp support**: Colour ramps are now available in many places in "
#~ "QGIS symbology settings and QGIS ships with a rich, extensible set of colour"
#~ " ramps. You can also design your own and many cpt-city themes are included "
#~ "in QGIS now 'out of the box'. Color ramps even have full support for "
#~ "transparency!"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Set custom default styles for all layer types**: Now QGIS lets you control"
#~ " how new layers will be drawn when they do not have an existing .qml style "
#~ "defined. You can also set the default transparency level for new layers and "
#~ "whether symbols should have random colours assigned to them."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Multipage support**: A single composer window can now contain more then "
#~ "one page."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Layer blending**: Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in "
#~ "new and exciting ways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make"
#~ " the layer transparent, you can now choose between much more advanced "
#~ "options such as \"multiply\", \"darken only\", and many more. Blending can "
#~ "be used in the normal map view as well as in print composer. For a short "
#~ "tutorial on how to use blending in print composer to make the most out of "
#~ "background images, see \"Vintage map design using QGIS\"."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Labelling"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**New labelling system**: The labelling system has been totally overhauled -"
#~ " it now includes many new features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', "
#~ "many more data bound options, and various performance enhancements. We are "
#~ "slowly doing away with the 'old labels' system, although you will still find"
#~ " that functionality available for this release, you should expect that it "
#~ "will disappear in a follow up release."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Older labelling engine deprecated**: Use of the older labelling engine "
#~ "available in QGIS <= 1.8 is now discouraged (i.e. deprecated), but has not "
#~ "been removed. This is to allow users to migrate existing projects from the "
#~ "old to new labelling engine. The following guidelines for working with the "
#~ "older engine in QGIS 2.0 apply:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Deprecated labelling tab is removed from vector layer properties dialog for "
#~ "new projects or older opened projects that don't use that labelling engine."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Deprecated tab remains active for older opened projects, if any layer uses "
#~ "them, and does not go away even if saving the project with no layers having "
#~ "the older labelling engine enabled."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Deprecated labelling tab can be enabled/disabled for the current project, "
#~ "via Python console commands. Please note: There is a very high likelihood "
#~ "the deprecated labelling engine will be completely removed prior to the next"
#~ " stable release of QGIS. Please migrate older projects."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**New Python Console**: The new Python console gives you even more power. "
#~ "Now the with auto complete support, syntax highlighting, adjustable font "
#~ "settings. The side code editor allows for easier entry of larger blocks of "
#~ "code with the ability to open and run any Python file in the QGIS session."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Even more expression functions**: With the expression engine being used "
#~ "more and more though out QGIS to allow for things like expression based "
#~ "labels and symbol, many more functions have been added to the expression "
#~ "builder and are all accessible though the expression builder. All functions "
#~ "include comprehensive help and usage guides for ease of use."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**New cleaner Python API**: The Python API has been revamped to allow for a "
#~ "more cleaner, more pythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses "
#~ "SIP V2 which removes the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed "
#~ "when working with values. Types are now converted into native Python types "
#~ "making for a much nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature "
#~ "itself using a simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Processing Support**: The SEXTANTE project has been ported to and "
#~ "incorporated into QGIS as core functionality. SEXTANTE has been renamed to "
#~ "'Processing' and introduces a new menu in QGIS from where you can access a "
#~ "rich toolbox of spatial analysis tools. The processing toolbox has "
#~ "incredibly rich functionality - with a python programming API allowing you "
#~ "to easily add new tools, and hooks to provide access to analysis "
#~ "capabilities of many popular open source tools such as GRASS, OTB, SAGA etc."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Processing Modeller**: One of the great features of the new processing "
#~ "framework is the ability to combine the tools graphically. Using the "
#~ "Processing Modeller, you can build up complex analysis from a series of "
#~ "small single purpose modules. You can save these models and then use them as"
#~ " building blocks in even more complex models. Awesome power integrated right"
#~ " into QGIS and very easy to use!"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Revamped plugin manager**: In QGIS 1.x managing plugins was somewhat "
#~ "confusing with two interfaces - one for managing already installed plugins "
#~ "and one for fetching python plugins from an only plugin repository. In QGIS "
#~ "2.0 we introduce a new, unified, plugin manager which provides a one stop "
#~ "shop for downloading, enabling/disabling and generally managing you plugins."
#~ " Oh, and the user interface is gorgeous too with side tabs and easy to "
#~ "recognise icons!"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Application and Project Options**: Define default startup project and "
#~ "project templates. With QGIS 2.0 you can specify what QGIS should do when it"
#~ " starts: New Project (legacy behaviour, starts with a blank project), Most "
#~ "recent (when you start QGIS it will load the last project you worked on), "
#~ "Specific (always load a specific project when QGIS starts). You can use the "
#~ "project template directory to specify where your template projects should be"
#~ " stored. Any project that you store in that directory will be available for "
#~ "use as a template when invoking the Project --> New from template menu."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**User-defined zoom scales**: A listing of zoom scales can now be configured"
#~ " for the application and optionally overridden per project. The list will "
#~ "show up in the Scale popup combo box in the main window status bar, allowing"
#~ " for quick access to known scales for efficiently viewing and working with "
#~ "the current data sources. Defined scales can be exported to an XML file that"
#~ " can be imported into other projects or another QGIS application."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Quantum GIS is now known only as 'QGIS'**: The 'Quantum' in 'Quantum GIS' "
#~ "never had any particular significance and the duality of referring to our "
#~ "project as both Quantum GIS and QGIS caused some confusion. We are "
#~ "streamlining our project and as part of that process we are officially "
#~ "dropping the use of the word Quantum - henceforth we will be known only as "
#~ "QGIS (spelled with all letters in upper case). We will be updating all our "
