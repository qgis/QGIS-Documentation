"There are generally two approaches when input data should be rendered as a "

"Map composer is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "
"sophisticated output than the simple rendering shown above. Using the "
"composer it is possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map "
"views, labels, legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on"
" paper maps. The layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or "
"directly printed on a printer."

"The composer consists of a bunch of classes. They all belong to the core "
"library. QGIS application has a convenient GUI for placement of the "
"elements, though it is not available in the gui library. If you are not "
"familiar with `Qt Graphics View framework "
"<http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/graphicsview.html>`_, then you are "
"encouraged to check the documentation now, because the composer is based on "
"it."

"Note that the composition takes an instance of :class:`QgsMapRenderer`. In "
"the code we expect we are running within QGIS application and thus use the "
"map renderer from map canvas. The composition uses various parameters from "
"the map renderer, most importantly the default set of map layers and the "
"current extent. When using composer in a standalone application, you can "
"create your own map renderer instance the same way as shown in the section "
"above and pass it to the composition."
