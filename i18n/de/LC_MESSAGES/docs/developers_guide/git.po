msgid ""
"The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during the"
" last years. Therefore it is hard to anticipate the side effects that the "
"addition of a feature will have. In the past, the QGIS project had very long"
" release cycles because it was a lot of work to reetablish the stability of "
"the software system after new features were added. To overcome these "
"problems, QGIS switched to a development model where new features are coded "
"in GIT branches first and merged to master (the main branch) when they are "
"finished and stable. This section describes the procedure for branching and "
"merging in the QGIS project."

"Before starting, make an announcement on the developer mailing list to see "
"if another developer is already working on the same feature. Also contact "
"the technical advisor of the project steering committee (PSC). If the new "
