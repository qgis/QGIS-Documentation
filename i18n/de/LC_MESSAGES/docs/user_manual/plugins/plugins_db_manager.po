"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of the |qg| core and is intended to"
" replace the SPIT Plugin and, additionally, to integrate all other database "
"formats supported by |qg| in one user interface. The |icon_dbmanager| "
":sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can drag layers from"
" the |qg| Browser into the DB Manager, and it will import your layer into "
"your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between spatial "
"databases and they will get imported. You can also use the DB Manager to "
"execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view the spatial "
"output for queries by adding the results to |qg| as a query layer."
