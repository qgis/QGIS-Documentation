"You can create your own algorithms by writing the corresponding Python code "

"define the semantics of the algorithm. You can find a :guilabel:`Create new "
"script` menu under the :guilabel:`Tools` group in the :guilabel:`Script` "
"algorithms block of the toolbox. Double-click on it to open the script "
"edition dialog. That's where you should type your code. Saving the script "
"from there in the :file:`scripts` folder (the default one when you open the "
"save file dialog), with :file:`.py` extension, will automatically create the"
" corresponding algorithm."
