"The Biodiversity Informatics Facility at the American Museum of Natural "
"History's (AMNH) Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) [1]_ has "
"developed the Event Visualization Tool (eVis), another software tool to add "
"to the suite of conservation monitoring and decision support tools for "
"guiding protected area and landscape planning. This plugin enables users to "
"easily link geocoded (i.e., referenced with latitude and longitude or X and "
"Y coordinates) photographs, and other supporting documents, to vector data "
"in QGIS."

"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
