#~ "tests!"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Creating a unit test is easy - typically you will do this by just creating a"
#~ " single .cpp file (not .h file is used) and implement all your test methods "
#~ "as public methods that return void. I'll use a simple test class for "
#~ "QgsRasterLayer throughout the section that follows to illustrate. By "
#~ "convention we will name our test with the same name as the class they are "
#~ "testing but prefixed with 'Test'. So our test implementation goes in a file "
#~ "called testqgsrasterlayer.cpp and the class itself will be "
#~ "TestQgsRasterLayer. First we add our standard copyright banner:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Next we use start our includes needed for the tests we plan to run. There is"
#~ " one special include all tests should have:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "All our test methods are implemented as private slots. The QtTest framework "
#~ "will sequentially call each private slot method in the test class. There are"
#~ " four 'special' methods which if implemented will be called at the start of "
#~ "the unit test (initTestCase), at the end of the unit test (cleanupTestCase)."
#~ " Before each test method is called, the init() method will be called and "
#~ "after each test method is called the cleanup() method is called. These "
#~ "methods are handy in that they allow you to allocate and cleanup resources "
#~ "prior to running each test, and the test unit as a whole."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Then come your test methods, all of which should take no parameters and "
#~ "should return void. The methods will be called in order of declaration. I am"
#~ " implementing two methods here which illustrates two types of testing. In "
#~ "the first case I want to generally test the various parts of the class are "
#~ "working, I can use a functional testing approach. Once again, extreme "
#~ "programmers would advocate writing these tests before implementing the "
#~ "class. Then as you work your way through your class implementation you "
#~ "iteratively run your unit tests. More and more test functions should "
#~ "complete sucessfully as your class implementation work progresses, and when "
#~ "the whole unit test passes, your new class is done and is now complete with "
#~ "a repeatable way to validate it."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Typically your unit tests would only cover the public API of your class, and"
#~ " normally you do not need to write tests for accessors and mutators. If it "

#~ "would normally implement a regression test to check for this (see lower "
#~ "down)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Next we implement our regression tests. Regression tests should be "
#~ "implemented to replicate the conditions of a particular bug. For example I "
#~ "recently received a report by email that the cell count by rasters was off "
#~ "by 1, throwing off all the statistics for the raster bands. I opened a bug "
#~ "(ticket #832) and then created a regression test that replicated the bug "
#~ "using a small test dataset (a 10x10 raster). Then I ran the test and ran it,"
#~ " verifying that it did indeed fail (the cell count was 99 instead of 100). "
#~ "Then I went to fix the bug and reran the unit test and the regression test "
#~ "passed. I committed the regression test along with the bug fix. Now if "
#~ "anybody breakes this in the source code again in the future, we can "
#~ "immediatly identify that the code has regressed. Better yet before "

#~ "To implement your regression test, you should follow the naming convention "

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Finally in our test class declaration you can declare privately any data "

#~ " raster layer will be created in the initTestCase() function which is run "
#~ "before any other tests, and then destroyed using cleanupTestCase() which is "
#~ "run after all tests. By declaring helper methods (which may be called by "

#~ "Secondly, this is a data driven test so we needed to provide a way to "
#~ "generically locate the ``tenbytenraster.asc`` file. This was achieved by "
#~ "using the compiler define ``TEST_DATA_PATH``. The define is created in the "
#~ "``CMakeLists.txt`` configuration file under ``<QGIS Source "
#~ "Root>/tests/CMakeLists.txt`` and is available to all QGIS unit tests. If you"
