"In this lesson we will perform some real analysis using just the toolbox, so"
" you can get more familiar with the processing framework elements."

"Now that everything is configured and we can use external algorithms, we "
"have a very powerful tool to perform spatial analysis. It is time to work "
"out a larger exercise with some real--world data."

"We will be using the well-known dataset that John Snow used in his "
"groundbreaking work, and we will get some interesting results. The analysis "
"of this dataset is pretty obvious and there is no need for sofisticated GIS "
"techniques to end up with good results and conclusions, but it is a good way"
" of showing how these spatial problems can be analyzed and solved by using "
"different processing tools."

"The dataset contains shapefiles with cholera deaths and pump locations, and "
"an OSM rendered map in TIFF format. Open the corresponding QGIS project for "

"The first thing to do is to calculting the Voronoi diagram (a.k.a. Thyessen "
"polygons) of the pumps layer, to get the influence zone of each pump. The "
"*Voronoi Diagram* algorithm can be used for that."

"To get a more quantitative result, we can count the number of deaths in each"
" polygon. Since each point represents a building where deaths occured, and "
"the number of deaths is stored in an attribute, we cannot just count the "
"points. We need a weighted count, so we will use the *Count points in "
"polygon (weighted)* tool."

"The new field will be called *DEATHS*, and we use the *COUNT* field as "
"weighting field. The resulting table clearly reflects that the number of "
"deaths in the polygon corresponding to the first pump is much larger than "
"the other ones."

"Another good way of visualizing the dependence of each point in the "
"``Cholera_deaths`` layer with a point in the ``Pumps`` layer is to draw a "
"line to the closest one. This can be done with the *Distance to closest hub*"
" tool, and using the configuration shown next."

"Although the number of lines is larger in the case of the central pump, do "
"not forget that this does not represent the number of deaths, but the number"
" of locations where cholera cases were found. It is a representative "
"parameter, but it is not considering that some locations might have more "
"cases than other."

"A density layer will also give us a very clear view of what is happening. We"
" can create it with the *Kernel density* algorithm. Using the "
"*Cholera_deaths* layer, its *COUNT* field as weight field, with a radius of "
"100, the extent and cellsize of the streets raster layer, we get something "
"like this."

"Select the streets raster layer and its extent will be automatically added "
"to the text field. You must do the same with the cellsize, selecting the "
"cellsize of that layer as well."
msgstr "Seleccione la capa de calles ráster y su extensión automáticamente se añadirá al campo de texto. Debe hacer lo mismo con el tamaño de celda, seleccionando el tamaño de celda de esa capa también."

"Combining with the pumps layer, we see that there is one pump clearly in the"
" hotspot where the maximum density of death cases is found."
msgstr "La combinación con la capa de bombas, vemos que hay una bomba claramente en el punto de acceso donde se encuentra la máxima densidad de los casos de muerte."
