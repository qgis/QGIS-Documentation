"All the analysis performed with the processing framework is logged in its "
"own logging system. This allows you to know more about what has been done "
"with the processing tools, to solve problems when they happen, and also to "
"re--run previous operations, since the logging system also implements some "
"interactivity."
msgstr "Todas as análises realizadas com a estrutura de processamento são registradas em seu próprio sistema de registros. Isso permite que você saiba mais sobre o que foi feito com as ferramentas de processamento, para resolver os problemas quando eles acontecem, e também para reexecutar as operações anteriores, uma vez que o sistema de registros também implementa alguma interatividade."

"*Info*. Some algorithms might leave here information about their execution. "
"For instance, those algorithms that call an external application usually log"
" the console output of that application to this entry. If you have a look at"
" it, you will see that the output of the SAGA algorithm that we just run "
"(and that fail to execute because input data was not correct) is stored "
"here."
msgstr "*Informação*. Alguns algoritmos podem deixar aqui informações sobre a sua execução. Por exemplo, os algoritmos que exigem uma aplicação externa geralmente registram a saída do console de que há aplicação para esta entrada. Se você der uma olhada nele, você vai ver que a saída do algoritmo SAGA que acabamos de executar (e que não conseguem executar porque os dados de entrada não estava correto) foi armazenada aqui."

"This is helpful to understand what is going on. Advanced users will be able "
"to analyze that output to find out why the algorithm failed. If you are not "
"an advanced user, this will be useful for others to help you diagnose the "
"problem you are having, which might be a problem in the installation of the "
"external software or an issue with the data you provided."

"*Warnings*. Even if the algorithm could be executed, some algorithms might "
"leave warnings in case the result might not be right. For instance, when "
"executing an interpolation algorithm with a very small amount of points. The"
" algorithm can run and will produce a result, but it is likely that it will "
"not be correct, since more points should be used. It's a good idea to "
"regularly check for this type of warnings if you are not sure about some "
"aspect of a given algorithm."

"*Algorithms*. All algorithms that are executed, even if they are executed "
"from the GUI and not from the console (which will be explained later in this"
" manual) are stored in this part of the log as a console call. That means "
"that everytime you run an algorithm, a console command is added to the log, "
"and you have the full history of your working session. Here is how that "
"history looks like"

"This can be very useful when starting working with the console, to learn "

"The history is also interactive, and you can re--run any previous algorithm "

"For instance, try the following. Open the data corresponding to the first "
"chapter of this manual and run the algorithm explained there. Now go to the "
"log dialog and locate the last algorithm in the list, which corresponds to "
"the algorithm you have just run. Double--click on it an a new result should "
"be produced, just like when you run it using the normal dialog and calling "
"it from the toolbox."
