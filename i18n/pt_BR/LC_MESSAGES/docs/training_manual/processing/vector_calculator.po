"We already know how to use the raster calculator to create new raster layers"
" usig mathematical expressions. A similar algorithm is available for vector "

"layer, plus an additional on with the result of the expression entered. The "

"First, let's calculate the population density of white people in each "

" have to divide them and multiply by one million (to have density per square"
" km), so we can use the following formula in the corresponding field"
