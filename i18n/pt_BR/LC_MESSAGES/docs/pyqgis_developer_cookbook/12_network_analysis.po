The director sets the basic settings that will be used to construct a graph from a line vector layer, used by the builder to create graph. Currently, as in the case with the director, only one builder exists: `QgsGraphBuilder <http://qgis.org/api/api/classQgsGraphBuilder.html>`_, that creates `QgsGraph <http://qgis.org/api/api/classQgsGraph.html>`_ objects.
