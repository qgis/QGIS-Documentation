"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those"
" learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."
msgstr "A informação do processo é mantida como uma expressão de linha de comandos, mesmo se o algoritmo seja lançado a partir da barra de ferramentas. Isto permite ser útil para aqueles que querem aprender como se usa a interface da linha de comandos, uma vez que podem chamar o algortimo usando a barra de ferramentas e verificar o gestor histórico para ver como o mesmo algoritmo pode ser chamado a partir da linha de comandos."
