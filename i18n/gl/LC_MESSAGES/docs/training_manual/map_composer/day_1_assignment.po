"If this course is being presented to you, the course presenter may require "
"you to submit a final version of your map, exported to PDF, for evaluation. "
"If you're doing this course by yourself, it's recommended that you evaluate "
"your own map using the same criteria. Your map will be evaluated on the "
"overall appearance and symbology of the map itself, as well as the "
"appearance and layout of the map page and elements.  Remember that the "
"emphasis for evaluating the appearance of maps will always be *ease of use*."
" The nicer the map is to look at and the easier it is to understand at a "
"glance, the better."
