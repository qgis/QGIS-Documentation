"Topology describes the relationships between points, lines and polygons that"

"plugin you can look over your vector files and check the topology with "

"your features 'Equal', 'Contain', 'Cover', are 'CoveredBy', 'Cross', "
"'Disjoint', 'Intersect', 'Overlap', 'Touches' and are 'Within' each other. "
"It depends on your individual questions which topology rules you apply to "
