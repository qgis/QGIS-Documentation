"All algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. That "
"is, they can be executed using not a single set of inputs, but several of "
"them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is useful when "
"processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary to launch the "
"algorithm many times from the toolbox."

"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an "
"algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not"
" just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for "
"each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a "
"table like the one shown next."
