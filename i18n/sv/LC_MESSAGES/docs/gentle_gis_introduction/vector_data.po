"Map **scale** is an important issue to consider when working with vector "
"data in a GIS. When data is captured, it is usually digitised from existing "

"system devices. Maps have different scales, so if you import vector data "
"from a map into a GIS environment (for example by digitising paper maps), "
"the digital vector data will have the same scale issues as the original map. "
"This effect can be seen in Illustrations figure_vector_small_scale_ and "
"figure_vector_large_scale_. Many issues can arise from making a poor choice "
"of map scale. For example using the vector data in Illustration "
"figure_vector_small_scale_ to plan a wetland conservation area could result "
