"The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and perform"
" complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other GUI "
"elements of the processing framework GUI. Models involving several "
"algorithms can be defined using the command-line interface, and additional "
"operations such as loops and conditional sentences can be added to create "
"more flexible and powerful workflows."
