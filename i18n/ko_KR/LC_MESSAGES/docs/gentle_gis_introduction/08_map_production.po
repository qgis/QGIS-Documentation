"Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of paper "

"with no professional background in GIS. Because of this, a map has to be "
"effective in communicating spatial information. Common elements of a map are"
" the title, map body, legend, north arrow, scale bar, acknowledgement, and "
"map border (see  )."

"the most important part of the map because it contains the map information. "
"The other elements support the communication process and help the map reader"
" to orientate himself and understand the map topic. For example, the title "
"describes the subject matter and the legend relates map symbols to the "
