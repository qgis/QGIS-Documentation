"**Spatial analysis** is the process of manipulating spatial information to "
"extract new information and meaning from the original data. Usually spatial "
"analysis is carried out with a Geographic Information System (GIS). A GIS "
"usually provides spatial analysis tools for calculating feature statistics "
"and carrying out geoprocessing activities as data interpolation. In "
"hydrology, users will likely emphasize the importance of terrain analysis "
"and hydrological modelling (modelling the movement of water over and in the "
"earth). In wildlife management, users are interested in analytical functions"
" dealing with wildlife point locations and their relationship to the "
"environment. Each user will have different things they are interested in "
"depending on the kind of work they do."

"Spatial interpolation is the process of using points with known values to "
"estimate values at other unknown points. For example, to make a "
"precipitation (rainfall) map for your country, you will not find enough "
"evenly spread weather stations to cover the entire region. Spatial "
"interpolation can estimate the temperatures at locations without recorded "
"data by using known temperature readings at nearby weather stations (see "
"figure_temperature_map_). This type of interpolated surface is often called "
"a **statistical surface**. Elevation data, precipitation, snow accumulation,"
" water table and population density are other types of data that can be "
"computed using interpolation."

"Weighting is assigned to sample points through the use of a weighting "
"coefficient that controls how the weighting influence will drop off as the "
"distance from new point increases. The greater the weighting coefficient, "
"the less the effect points will have if they are far from the unknown point "
"during the interpolation process. As the coefficient increases, the value of"
