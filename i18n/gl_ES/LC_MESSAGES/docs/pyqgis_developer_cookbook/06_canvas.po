"The Map canvas widget is probably the most important widget within QGIS "
"because it shows the map composed from overlaid map layers and allows "
"interaction with the map and layers. The canvas shows always a part of the "
"map defined by the current canvas extent. The interaction is done through "
"the use of **map tools**: there are tools for panning, zooming, identifying "
"layers, measuring, vector editing and others. Similar to other graphics "
"programs, there is always one tool active and the user can switch between "
"the available tools."

"Map canvas is implemented as :class:`QgsMapCanvas` class in :mod:`qgis.gui` "
"module.  The implementation is based on the Qt Graphics View framework. This "
"framework generally provides a surface and a view where custom graphics "
"items are placed and user can interact with them.  We will assume that you "
"are familiar enough with Qt to understand the concepts of the graphics "
"scene, view and items. If not, please make sure to read the `overview of the "
"framework <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/graphicsview.html>`_."

"Whenever the map has been panned, zoomed in/out (or some other action "
"triggers a refresh), the map is rendered again within the current extent. "
"The layers are rendered to an image (using :class:`QgsMapRenderer` class) "
"and that image is then displayed in the canvas. The graphics item (in terms "
"of the Qt graphics view framework) responsible for showing the map is :class:"
"`QgsMapCanvasMap` class. This class also controls refreshing of the rendered "
"map. Besides this item which acts as a background, there may be more **map "
"canvas items**. Typical map canvas items are rubber bands (used for "
"measuring, vector editing etc.) or vertex markers. The canvas items are "
"usually used to give some visual feedback for map tools, for example, when "
"creating a new polygon, the map tool creates a rubber band canvas item that "
"shows the current shape of the polygon. All map canvas items are subclasses "
"of :class:`QgsMapCanvasItem` which adds some more functionality to the basic "
"``QGraphicsItem`` objects."
