"The *Toolbox* is the main element of the SEXTANTE GUI, and the one that you "
"are more likely to use in your daily work. It shows the list of all "
"available algorithms grouped in different blocks, and is the access point to"
" run them whether as a single process or as a batch process involving "
"several executions of a same algorithm on different sets of inputs."

"The toolbox contains all the algorithms available, divided into groups. Each"
" group represents a so-called algorithm provider, which is a set of "
"algorithms coming from the same source, for instance, from a third-party "
"application with geoprocessing capabilities. Some of this groups represent "
"algorithms from one of such third-party applications (like SAGA, GRASS or "
"R), while other contain algorithms directly coded along with SEXTANTE "
"elements, not relying on any additional software. Currently, these providers"
" all reuse code from already-existing QGIS plugins (more specifically, from "
"the *fTools* vector library shiped along with QGIS and the contributed "
"mmqgis plugin that you can install using the plugin manager), making them "
"more useful, since they can be executed from elements such as the modeler or"
" the batch processing interface, which we will soon describe."
