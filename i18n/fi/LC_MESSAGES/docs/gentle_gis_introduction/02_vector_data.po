"Working with vector data does have some problems. We already mentioned the "

"capture the data are not properly set up, when the people capturing the data"
" aren't being careful, when time or money don't allow for enough detail in "
"the collection process, and so on. If you have poor quality vector data, you"

"**slivers** can occur when the edges of two polygon areas don't meet "
"properly (see  ). **Overshoots** can occur when a line feature such as a "
