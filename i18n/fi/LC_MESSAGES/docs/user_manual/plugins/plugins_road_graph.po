"As a roads layer you can use any polyline vector layer in any QGIS supported"
" format. Two lines with a common point are considered connected. Please "
"note, it is required to use layer CRS as project CRS while editing roads "
"layer. This is due to the fact that recalculation of the coordinates between"
" different CRS introduce some errors that can result in discontinuities, "
"even when 'snapping' is used."
