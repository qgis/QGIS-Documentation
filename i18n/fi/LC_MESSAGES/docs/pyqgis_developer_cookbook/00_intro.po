"Starting from 0.9 release, QGIS has optional scripting support using Python "
"language. We've decided for Python as it's one of the most favourite "
"languages for scripting. PyQGIS bindings depend on SIP and PyQt4. The reason"
" for using SIP instead of more widely used SWIG is that the whole QGIS code "
"depends on Qt libraries. Python bindings for Qt (PyQt) are done also using "
"SIP and this allows seamless integration of PyQGIS with PyQt."
