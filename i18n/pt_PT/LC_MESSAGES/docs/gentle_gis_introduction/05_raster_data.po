"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information"
" that is continuous across an area and cannot easily be divided into vector "
"features. When we introduced you to vector data we showed you the image in "
"figure_landscape_. Point, polyline and polygon features work well for "
"representing some features on this landscape, such as trees, roads and "
"building footprints. Other features on a landscape can be more difficult to "
"represent using vector features. For example the grasslands shown have many "
"variations in colour and density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a"
" single polygon around each grassland area, but a lot of the information "
"about the grassland would be lost in the process of simplifying the features"
" to a single polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature "
"attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very "
"good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) "
"all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "
"variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with "
"that approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create "
"a good vector dataset."

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "
"cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. risk of fire on a scale"

"Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth's "
"surface an image or raster dataset was created. This positional information "
"is stored with the digital version of the aerial photo. When the GIS "
"application opens the photo, it uses the positional information to ensure "
"that the photo appears in the correct place on the map. Normally this "
"positional information consists of a coordinate for the top left pixel in "
"the image, the size of each pixel in the X direction, the size of each pixel"
" in the Y direction, and the amount (if any) by which the image is rotated. "
"With these few pieces of information, the GIS application can ensure that "
"raster data are displayed in the correct place. The georeferencing "
"information for a raster is often provided in a small text file accompanying"
" the raster."

"Raster data can be obtained in a number of ways. Two of the most common ways"

"Get your learners to create a raster map of your school by using A4 "
"transparency sheets with grid lines drawn on them. Overlay the "
"transparencies onto a toposheet or aerial photograph of your school. Now let"
" each learner or group of learners colour in cells that represent a certain "
"type of feature e.g. building, playground, sports field, trees, footpaths "
"etc. When they are all finished, overlay all the sheets together and see if "
"it makes a good raster map representation of your school. Which types of "
"features worked well when represented as rasters? How did your choice in "
"cell size affect your ability to represent different feature types?"

"If you don't have a computer available, you can understand raster data using"
" pen and paper. Draw a grid of squares onto a sheet of paper to represent "
"your soccer field. Fill the grid in with numbers representing values for "
"grass cover on your soccer field. If a patch is bare give the cell a value "
"of 0. If the patch is mixed bare and covered, give it a value of 1. If an "
"area is completely covered with grass, give it a value of 2. Now use pencil "
"crayons to colour the cells based on their values. Colour cells with value 2"
" dark green. Value 1 should get coloured light green, and value 0 coloured "
"in brown. When you finish, you should have a raster map of your soccer "
"field!"
