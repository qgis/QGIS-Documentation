"**Spatial analysis** uses spatial information to extract new and additional "
"meaning from GIS data. Usually spatial analysis is carried out using a GIS "
"Application. GIS Applications normally have spatial analysis tools for "
"feature statistics (e.g. how many vertices make up this polyline?) or "
"geoprocessing such as feature buffering. The types of spatial analysis that "
"are used vary according to subject areas. People working in water management"
" and research (hydrology) will most likely be interested in analysing "
"terrain and modelling water as it moves across it. In wildlife management "
"users are interested in analytical functions that deal with wildlife point "
"locations and their relationship to the environment. In this topic we will "
"discuss buffering as an example of a useful spatial analysis that can be "
"carried out with vector data."
