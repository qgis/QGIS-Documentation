"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 and WFS 1.0.0 implementation which, in"
" addition, implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. "
"The QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application "
"written in C++ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd)."
" It is funded by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in "
"Switzerland."
