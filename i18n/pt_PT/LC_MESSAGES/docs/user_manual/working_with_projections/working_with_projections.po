"QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (Coordinate "
"Reference System) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the "
"user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly "
"(OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All these features allow the "

"In order to use OTF projection, your data must contain information about its"
" coordinate reference system or you have to define a global, layer or "

"identifier that was specified when the layer was created. For data supported"
" by OGR, QGIS relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the"
" CRS. In the case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the Well Known"
" Text (:index:`WKT`) specification of the CRS. This projection file has the "
"same base name as the shapefile and a prj extension. For example, a "
"shapefile named :file:`alaska.shp` would have a corresponding projection "
