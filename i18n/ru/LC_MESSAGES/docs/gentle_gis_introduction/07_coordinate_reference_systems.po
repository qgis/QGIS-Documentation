"When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However "

"The process of creating map projections can be visualised by positioning a "

"**Accuracy of map projections**Map projections are never absolutely accurate"

"It is usually impossible to preserve all characteristics at the same time in"
" a map projection. This means that when you want to carry out accurate "
"analytical operations, you need to use a map projection that provides the "
"best characteristics for your analyses. For example, if you need to measure "
"distances on your map, you should try to use a map projection for your data "
"that provides high accuracy for distances.**Map projections with angular "
"conformity**When working with a globe, the main directions of the compass "
"rose (North, East, South and West) will always occur at 90 degrees to one "
"another. In other words, East will always occur at a 90 degree angle to "
"North. Maintaining **correct angular properties** can be preserved on a map "
"projection as well. A map projection that retains this property of angular "
"conformity is called a **conformal or orthomorphic projection**."

" distortions of areas, meaning that if area measurements are made on the "

"measurements will be. Examples are the **Mercator projection** (as shown in"

"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have"
" the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they "
"represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference "
"and educational maps most often require the use of **equal area "
"projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when "
"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for"
" example, you are trying to analyse a particular area in your town to find "
"out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "
"are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an "
"equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
"area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when "
"dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their"
" angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "
"area**, **Lambert's equal area** and **Mollweide Equal Area Cylindrical "
"projections** (shown in  ) are types of equal area projections that are "
"often encountered in GIS work.Keep in mind that map projection is a very "
"complex topic. There are hundreds of different projections available world "
"wide each trying to portray a certain portion of the earth's surface as "
"faithfully as possible on a flat piece of paper. In reality, the choice of "
"which projection to use, will often be made for you. Most countries have "
"commonly used projections and when data is exchanged people will follow the "
"**national trend**."
