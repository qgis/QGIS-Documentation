"**Topology** expresses the spatial relationships between connecting or "
"adjacent vector features (points, polylines and polygons) in a GIS. "
"Topological or topology-based data are useful for detecting and correcting "
"digitising errors (e.g. two lines in a roads vector layer that do not meet "
"perfectly at an intersection). Topology is necessary for carrying out some "
"types of spatial analysis, such as network analysis."

"topological information (data) about where it is possible to change trains. "
"Looking at a map of the underground, the topological relationships are "

"There are different types of topological errors and they can be grouped "
"according to whether the vector feature types are polygons or polylines. "
"Topological errors with **polygon** features can include unclosed polygons, "
"gaps between polygon borders or overlapping polygon borders. A common "
"topological error with **polyline** features is that they do not meet "
"perfectly at a point (node). This type of error is called an **undershoot** "
"if a gap exists between the lines, and an **overshoot** if a line ends "
"beyond the line it should connect to (see  )."

"Topological errors break the relationship between features. These errors "
"need to be fixed in order to be able to analyse vector data with procedures "
"like network analysis (e.g. finding the best route across a road network) or "
"measurement (e.g. finding out the length of a river). In addition to "
"topology being useful for network analysis and measurement, there are other "
"reasons why it is important and useful to create or have vector data with "
"correct topology. Just imagine you digitise a municipal boundaries map for "
"your province and the polygons overlap or show slivers. If such errors were "
"present, you would be able to use the measurement tools, but the results you "
"get will be incorrect. You will not know the correct area for any "
"municipality and you will not be able to define exactly, where the borders "
"between the municipalities are."
