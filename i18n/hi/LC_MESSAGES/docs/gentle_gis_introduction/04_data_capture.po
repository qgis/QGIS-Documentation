First, let's think about the geometry. We know that we can represent a vector layer using point, polyline or polygon features. Which one makes the most sense for our tourism map? We could use points if we wanted to mark specific locations such as look out points, memorials, battle sites and so on. If we wanted to take tourists along a route, such as a scenic route through a mountain pass, it might make sense to use polylines. If we have whole areas that are of tourism interest, such as a nature reserve or a cultural village, polygons might make a good choice."

They use the river areas (polygons) to represent river stretches that are wide, and they use river polylines to represent narrow stretches of river. In   we can see how our tourism layers might look on a map if we used all three geometry types."

The process of using a digitising table, is to place a paper map on the table. The paper map is held securely in place using clips. Then a special device called a 'puck' is used to trace features from the map. Tiny cross-hairs in the puck are used to ensure that lines and points are drawn accurately. The puck is connected to a computer and each feature that is captured using the puck gets stored in the computer's memory. You can see what a digitising puck looks like in  ."
