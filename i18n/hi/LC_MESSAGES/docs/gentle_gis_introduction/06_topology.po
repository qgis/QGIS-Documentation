msgid "**Topology** expresses the spatial relationships between connecting or adjacent vector features (points, polylines and polygons) in a GIS. Topological or topology-based data are useful for detecting and correcting digitising errors (e.g. two lines in a roads vector layer that do not meet perfectly at an intersection). Topology is necessary for carrying out some types of spatial analysis, such as network analysis."

msgid "Imagine you travel to London. On a sightseeing tour you plan to visit St. Paul's Cathedral first and in the afternoon Covent Garden Market for some souvenirs. Looking at the Underground map of London (see  ) you have to find connecting trains to get from Covent Garden to St. Paul's. This requires topological information (data) about where it is possible to change trains. Looking at a map of the underground, the topological relationships are illustrated by circles that show connectivity."

msgid "There are different types of topological errors and they can be grouped according to whether the vector feature types are polygons or polylines. Topological errors with **polygon** features can include unclosed polygons, gaps between polygon borders or overlapping polygon borders. A common topological error with **polyline** features is that they do not meet perfectly at a point (node). This type of error is called an **undershoot** if a gap exists between the lines, and an **overshoot** if a line ends beyond the line it should connect to (see  )."

msgid "Topological errors break the relationship between features. These errors need to be fixed in order to be able to analyse vector data with procedures like network analysis (e.g. finding the best route across a road network) or measurement (e.g. finding out the length of a river). In addition to topology being useful for network analysis and measurement, there are other reasons why it is important and useful to create or have vector data with correct topology. Just imagine you digitise a municipal boundaries map for your province and the polygons overlap or show slivers. If such errors were present, you would be able to use the measurement tools, but the results you get will be incorrect. You will not know the correct area for any municipality and you will not be able to define exactly, where the borders between the municipalities are."

A **segment** is a straight line formed between two vertices in a polygon or polyline geometry.

If you specify the search radius too small the GIS application won't find any feature or vertex to move or edit."
