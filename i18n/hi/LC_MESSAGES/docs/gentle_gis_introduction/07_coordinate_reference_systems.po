msgid "A traditional method of representing the earth's shape is the use of globes. There is, however, a problem with this approach. Although globes preserve the majority of the earth's shape and illustrate the spatial configuration of continent-sized features, they are very difficult to carry in one's pocket. They are also only convenient to use at extremely small scales (e.g. 1 : 100 million)."

msgid "Most of the thematic map data commonly used in GIS applications are of considerably larger scale. Typical GIS datasets have scales of 1:250 000 or greater, depending on the level of detail. A globe of this size would be difficult and expensive to produce and even more difficult to carry around. As a result, cartographers have developed a set of techniques called **map projections** designed to show, with reasonable accuracy, the spherical earth in two-dimensions."

msgid "When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However when viewed from space, we can see that the earth is relatively spherical. Maps, as we will see in the upcoming map production topic, are representations of reality. They are designed to not only represent features, but also their shape and spatial arrangement. Each map projection has **advantages** and **disadvantages**. The best projection for a map depends on the **scale** of the map, and on the purposes for which it will be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable distortions if used to map the entire African continent, but may be an excellent choice for a **large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. The properties of a map projection may also influence some of the design features of the map. Some projections are good for small areas, some are good for mapping areas with a large East-West extent, and some are better for mapping areas with a large North-South extent. **The three families of map projections**"

msgid "The process of creating map projections can be visualised by positioning a light source inside a transparent globe on which opaque earth features are placed. Then project the feature outlines onto a two-dimensional flat piece of paper. Different ways of projecting can be produced by surrounding the globe in a **cylindrical** fashion, as a **cone**, or even as a **flat surface**. Each of these methods produces what is called a **map projection family**. Therefore, there is a family of **planar projections**, a family of **cylindrical projections**, and another called **conical projections** (see )"

msgid "**Accuracy of map projections**Map projections are never absolutely accurate representations of the spherical earth. As a result of the map projection process, every map shows **distortions of angular conformity, distance and area**. A map projection may combine several of these characteristics, or may be a compromise that distorts all the properties of area, distance and angular conformity, within some acceptable limit. Examples of compromise projections are the** Winkel Tripel projection** and the **Robinson projection** (see  ), which are often used for world maps."

msgid "It is usually impossible to preserve all characteristics at the same time in a map projection. This means that when you want to carry out accurate analytical operations, you need to use a map projection that provides the best characteristics for your analyses. For example, if you need to measure distances on your map, you should try to use a map projection for your data that provides high accuracy for distances.**Map projections with angular conformity**When working with a globe, the main directions of the compass rose (North, East, South and West) will always occur at 90 degrees to one another. In other words, East will always occur at a 90 degree angle to North. Maintaining **correct angular properties** can be preserved on a map projection as well. A map projection that retains this property of angular conformity is called a **conformal or orthomorphic projection**."

msgid "These projections are used when the **preservation of angular relationships** is important. They are commonly used for navigational or meteorological tasks. It is important to remember that maintaining true angles on a map is difficult for large areas and should be attempted only for small portions of the earth. The conformal type of projection results in distortions of areas, meaning that if area measurements are made on the map, they will be incorrect. The larger the area the less accurate the area measurements will be. Examples are the **Mercator projection** (as shown in  ) and the **Lambert Conformal Conic projection**. The U.S. Geological Survey uses a conformal projection for many of its topographic maps.**Map projections with equal distance**"

msgid "When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference and educational maps most often require the use of **equal area projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for example, you are trying to analyse a particular area in your town to find out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal area**, **Lambert's equal area** and **Mollweide Equal Area Cylindrical projections** (shown in  ) are types of equal area projections that are often encountered in GIS work.Keep in mind that map projection is a very complex topic. There are hundreds of different projections available world wide each trying to portray a certain portion of the earth's surface as faithfully as possible on a flat piece of paper. In reality, the choice of which projection to use, will often be made for you. Most countries have commonly used projections and when data is exchanged people will follow the **national trend**."

To simplify the digitisation of maps, degrees of latitude in the southern hemisphere are often assigned negative values (0 to -90°).
