"This is how a WMS works: it's a map, similar to a normal map on paper, that "
"you receive as an image. What usually happens is that you have vector "
"layers, which QGIS renders as a map. But using a WMS, those vector layers "
"are on the WMS server, which renders it as a map and sends that map to you "
"as an image.  QGIS can display this image, but can't change its symbology, "
"because all that is handled on the server."

"On the other hand, you can't change the symbology if you don't like it, and "
