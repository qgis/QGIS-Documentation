msgid "Open the attribute table choosing |mActionOpenTable| :sup:`Open Attribute Table` from the menu bar. Click on the **[Advanced Search]** button to open the :guilabel:`Query builder`. For example, if you have a ``towns`` layer with a ``population`` field you could select only larger towns by entering ``population > 100000`` in the SQL box of the Query builder. Figure_attributes_2_ shows an example of the Query builder populated with data from a PostGIS layer with attributes stored in PostgreSQL. The Fields, Values and Operators sections help the user to construct the SQL-like query."

If you perform a SQL query here only the selected features are displayed in the map view. Features that don't match the SQL query are not visualised in the map view. The same function is available from the :guilabel:`General` tab in the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog. You can find a **[Query builder]** button right below. The selection described above can be used with all vector data providers."
