"HABEaS - Hotspot Areas for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is an online "
"geographic information system (WebGIS) that was created by the `Centre for "
"Applied Ecology <http://www.isa.utl.pt/ceabn/content/2/123/homepage>`_ "
"(`Instituto Superior de Agronomia <http://www.isa.utl.pt/home/>`_, Technical "
"University of Lisbon), Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Faunalia. The "
"main goal of this platform is to provide free access to a wide variety of "
"data on biodiversity and ecosystem services for the Mediterranean Basin that "
"was scattered across a number of public and private entities. Presently "
"HABEaS WebGIS covers the south of Portugal, but by the end of 2012/early "
"2013 it will be expanded to the north of Portugal and also to the Tuzla "
"Canton in Bosnia & Herzegovina. In the long run we want to expand this tool "
"to the entire Mediterranean Basin."

"Since the main goal of this tool is to promote free and easy access to "
"information on biodiversity and ecosystem services we decided to use only "
"free and open source software, that any person or entity can use regardless "
"of their location or financial constraints. The website where HABEaS WebGIS "
"is hosted on a server that runs Debian Linux and was developed with Drupal "
"CMS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS was used to store the data and Quantum GIS was used "
"to process and analyze the GIS that we obtained from several entities. We "
"used both Quantum GIS's native tools but also GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools "
"through the GRASS plugin and SEXTANTE Toolbox."

"The geographic information contained in HABEaS has also been used by WWF to "
"provide support for the identification of High Conservation Value Forests "
"(HCVF) in the south of Portugal, which is a mandatory step for landowners "
"that want their forests to receive Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) "
"Certification."

"To determine which conservation values occure in each property we used "
"SEXTANTE Modeller to create a script that intersects all HABEaS layers with "
"the boundaries of the property. Using the same tool we were also able to "
"create a script that automatically calculates the amount of carbon that is "
"currently stored in each property."

"Quantum GIS is easy to use and has very powerful geoprocessing capabilities. "
"The integration of GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through SEXTANTE Toolbox "
"allowed us to perform a number of complex spatial analyzes and to pipeline "
"them using SEXTANTE Modeler. It was also very easy to produce high quality "
"maps with the new Print Composer and to export them in SVG format for "
"further editing with Inkscape which is a powerful open source vector "
"graphics editor. In general, our experience with Quantum GIS has been very "
"positive, the software runs smoothly and the community is very active and "
"supportive. Reported bugs are usually resolved shortly after being reported "
"by users and Quantum GIS developers are always willing to listen to “end "
"user's” needs and suggestions."
