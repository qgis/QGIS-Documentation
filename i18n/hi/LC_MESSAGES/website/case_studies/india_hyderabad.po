msgid "The National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) is an Apex institute of Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. Headquarter is located at Hyderabad city of India and it has three sub centres at Guwahati, Jaipur and Patna city. Jaipur city is capital of Rajasthan State (North Western side of country). The NIRD Jaipur Centre is actively involved in short (mostly 5 days including one-day handheld GPS survey and local visit) residential GIS trainings for middle level government officials of North Indian States. Reputed NGOs and Scholars are also trained if interested. Trainings are fully sponsored by NIRD and participants are to bear only their travel expenses. The author is working in NIRD Jaipur centre as an Assistant Professor and coordinating GIS and Watershed related trainings at the centre. Initially at the time of his posting at Headquarter of NIRD at Hyderabad, he was involved in GIS trainings with commercial software like ArcGIS and ERDAS. After getting opportunity of a two days training on QuantumGIS at IIT Madras in 2009, it was felt that the Open Source GIS can fulfil the need of Rural Development sector of India. The version learnt in training was QGIS 1.0.2. The training feedback was provided to seniors and it was recommended to introduce QGIS in further trainings but apprehensions were there in accepting the software in mainstream of trainings. Software was then pursued for the personal use for one year and its new versions were checked for the enhanced functionalities. During this whenever author was course coordinator in training, he used QGIS in trainings for introduction and feedbacks."

msgid "There is a question why QGIS only when other software like uDig, MapWindow, gvSIG, GRASS are also there. The answer lies in the facts that QGIS is an OSGeo incubated project, less complex, its development is very fast and associated with huge community of users and developers and lastly authors expertise. With its latest version of 1.8, software is capable of satisfying the all needs of grass root rural development executors in India with satisfying the present queries and wishes for future."
