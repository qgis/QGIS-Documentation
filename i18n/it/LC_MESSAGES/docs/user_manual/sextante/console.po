"As in the case of models, you can create additional documentation for your "
"script, to explain what they do and how to use them. In the script editing "
"dialog you will find a *Edit script help* button. Click on it and it will "
"take you to the help editing dialog. Check the chapter about the graphical "
"modeler to know more about this dialog and how to use it."

"Help files are saved in the same folder as the script itself, adding the "
"*.help* extension to the filename. Notice that you can edit your script's "
"help before saving it for the first time. If you later close the script "
"editing dialog without saving the script (i.e. you discard it), the help "
"content you wrote will be lost. If your script was already saved and is "
"associated to a filename, saving is done automatically."
