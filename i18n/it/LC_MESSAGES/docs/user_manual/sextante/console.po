"The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and perform "
"complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other elements "
"of the SEXTANTE GUI. Models involving several algorithms can be defined "
"using the command-line interface, and additional operations such as loops "

"``runalg()`` method, which takes the name of the algorithm to execute as its "
"first parameter, and then a variable number of additional parameter "
"depending on the requirements of the algorithm. So the first thing you need "
"to know is the name of the algorithm to execute. That is not the name you "
"see in the toolbox, but rather a unique command–line name. To find the right "
"name for your algorithm, you can use the ``algslist()`` method. Type the "

"As in the case of models, you can create additional documentation for your "
"script, to explain what they do and how to use them. In the script editing "
"dialog you will find a **[Edit script help]** button. Click on it and it "
"will take you to the help editing dialog. Check the chapter about the "
"graphical modeler to know more about this dialog and how to use it."

"Help files are saved in the same folder as the script itself, adding the :"
"file:`.help` extension to the filename. Notice that you can edit your "
"script's help before saving it for the first time. If you later close the "
"script editing dialog without saving the script (i.e. you discard it), the "
"help content you wrote will be lost. If your script was already saved and is "
"associated to a filename, saving is done automatically."
