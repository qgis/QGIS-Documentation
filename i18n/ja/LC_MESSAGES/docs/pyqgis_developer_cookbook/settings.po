"These variables can be saved a retrieved with help of Qt and QGIS API. For "
"each variable, you should pick a key that will be used to access the "
"variable --- for user's favourite color you could use key "
"\"favourite_color\" or any other meaningful string. It is recommended to "
"give some structure to naming of keys."

"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at particular machine. "
"QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main window size "
"or default snapping tolerance. This functionality is provided directly by Qt"
" framework by the means of QSettings class. By default, this class stores "
"settings in system's \"native\" way of storing settings, that is --- "
"registry (on Windows), .plist file (on Mac OS X) or .ini file (on Unix). The"
" `QSettings documentation <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/qsettings.html>`_ "
"is comprehensive, so we will provide just a simple example::"

"**project settings** --- vary between different projects and therefore they "
"are connected with a project file. Map canvas background color or "
"destination coordinate reference system (CRS) are examples --- white "
"background and WGS84 might be suitable for one project, while yellow "
"background and UTM projection are better for another one. An example of "
"usage follows::"

"**map layer settings** --- these settings are related to a particular "
"instance of a map layer with a project. They are *not* connected with "
"underlying data source of a layer, so if you create two map layer instances "
"of one shapefile, they will not share the settings. The settings are stored "
"in project file, so if the user opens the project again, the layer-related "
"settings will be there again. This functionality has been added in QGIS "
"v1.4. The API is similar to QSettings --- it takes and returns QVariant "
"instances::"
