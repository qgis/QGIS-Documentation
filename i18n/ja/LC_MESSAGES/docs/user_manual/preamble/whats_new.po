"100% page scale using the new Zoom to 100% tool on the toolbar. The composer"

"items, so holding :kbd:`Shift` while moving an item constrains the movement "

"atlas page. Atlas map settings have been moved from the atlas panel to the "
"map properties panel, so now, more than one map can be controlled by the "
"atlas generation. There's a new option to automatically centre an overview "

"to help you navigate your compositions. You can now zoom in or out from a "
"composition by using the mouse scroll wheel. A dedicated pan tool has been "
"added, which allows you to drag the composition around, and you can also "
"switch immediately to pan mode by holding the space bar or by holding the "
"mouse scroll wheel. There's also a new zoom tool, which allows you to "
"precisely zoom to a specific area of your composition. You can also switch "

"transparent) background. Shape items (rectangles, triangles and ellipses) "
