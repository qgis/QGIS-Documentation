"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those"
" learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."
msgstr "プロセス情報は、アルゴリズムをツールボックスから起動された場合でも、コマンドライン式として保持されます。ツールボックスを使用してアルゴリズムを呼び出し、それからヒストリーマネージャでコマンドラインから呼び出したアルゴリズムを確認するため、それはコマンドラインインタフェースを使い方を学習するのにも役立ちます。"
