"For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a "
"cell phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes "
"need to be synchronized with the master data source, e.g. a PostGIS "
"database. If several persons are working simultaneously on the same "
"datasets, it is difficult to merge the edits by hand, even if people don’t "
"change the same features."

"The |offline_editing_copy|:sup:`Offline Editing` Plugin automates the "
"synchronisation by copying the content of a datasource (usually PostGIS or "
"WFS-T) to a SpatiaLite database and storing the offline edits to dedicated "
"tables. After being connected to the network again, it is possible to apply "
"the offline edits to the master dataset."
