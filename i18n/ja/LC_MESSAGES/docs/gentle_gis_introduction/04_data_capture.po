"As you have probably discovered by now if you followed the steps above, it "
"is pretty hard to draw the features so that they are **spatially correct** "
"if you do not have other features that you can use as a point of reference. "
"One common solution to this problem is to use a raster layer (such as an "
"aerial photograph or a satellite image) as a backdrop layer. You can then "
"use this layer as a reference map, or even trace the features off the raster"
" layer into your vector layer if they are visible. This process is known as "
"'heads-up digitising' and is shown in  ."

"Another method of capturing vector data is to use a digitising table. This "
"approach is less commonly used except by GIS professionals, and it requires "
"expensive equipment. The process of using a digitising table, is to place a "
"paper map on the table. The paper map is held securely in place using clips."
" Then a special device called a 'puck' is used to trace features from the "
"map. Tiny cross-hairs in the puck are used to ensure that lines and points "
"are drawn accurately. The puck is connected to a computer and each feature "
"that is captured using the puck gets stored in the computer's memory. You "
