#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Vector** data provide a way to represent real world **features** within "
#~ "the GIS environment. A feature is anything you can see on the landscape. "
#~ "Imagine you are standing on the top of a hill. Looking down you can see "
#~ "houses, roads, trees, rivers, and so on (see  ). Each one of these things "
#~ "would be a **feature **when we represent them in a GIS Application. Vector "
#~ "features have **attributes**, which consist of text or numerical information"
#~ " that **describe** the features."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "A vector feature has its shape represented using **geometry**. The geometry "
#~ "is made up of one or more interconnected **vertices**. A vertex describes a "
#~ "position in space using an **x**, **y** and optionally **z** axis. "
#~ "Geometries which have vertices with a z axis are often referred to as "
#~ "**2.5D** since they describe height or depth at each vertex, but not both."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When a feature's geometry consists of only a single vertex, it is referred "
#~ "to as a **point** feature (see Illustration  ). Where the geometry consists "
#~ "of two or more vertices and the first and last vertex are not equal, a "
#~ "**polyline** feature is formed (see Illustration  ). Where four or more "
#~ "vertices are present, and the last vertex is equal to the first, an enclosed"
#~ " **polygon** feature is formed (see Illustration  )."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Looking back at the picture of a landscape we showed you further up, you "
#~ "should be able to see the different types of features in the way that a GIS "
#~ "represents them now (see Illustration  )."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Point features in detail:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As we show in Illustration , a point feature has an X,Y and optionally, Z "
#~ "value. The X and Y values will depend on the **Coordinate Reference System**"
#~ " (CRS) being used. We are going to go into more detail about Coordinate "
#~ "Reference Systems in a later tutorial. For now let's simply say that a CRS "
#~ "is a way to accurately describe where a particular place is on the earth's "
#~ "surface. One of the most common reference systems is **Longitude and "
#~ "Latitude**. Lines of Longitude run from the North Pole to the South Pole. "
#~ "Lines of Latitude run from the East to West. You can describe precisely "
#~ "where you are at any place on the earth by giving someone your Longitude (X)"
#~ " and Latitude (Y). If you make a similar measurement for a tree or a "
#~ "telephone pole and marked it on a map, you will have created a point "
#~ "feature."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Polyline features in detail:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Where a point feature is a single vertex, **a polyline has two or more "
#~ "vertices**. The polyline is a continuous path drawn through each vertex, as "
#~ "shown in  ). When two vertices are joined, a line is created. When more than"
#~ " two are joined, they form a 'line of lines', or **polyline**."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If a curved polyline has very large distances between vertices, it may "
#~ "appear **angular** or jagged, depending on the scale at which it is viewed "
#~ "(see  ). Because of this it is important that polylines are digitised "
#~ "(captured into the computer) with distances between vertices that are small "
#~ "enough for the scale at which you want to use the data."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Polygon features in detail:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Polygon features are **enclosed areas** like dams, islands, country "
#~ "boundaries and so on. Like polyline features, polygons are created from a "
#~ "series of vertices that are connected with a continuous line. However "
#~ "because a polygon always describes an enclosed area, the first and last "
#~ "vertices should always be at the same place! Polygons often have **shared "
#~ "geometry** – boundaries that are in common with a neighbouring polygon. Many"
#~ " GIS applications have the capability to ensure that the boundaries of "
#~ "neighbouring polygons exactly coincide. We will explore this in the "
#~ "**topology** topic later in this tutorial."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Vector data in layers:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Editing vector data:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The GIS application will allow you to create and modify the geometry data in"
#~ " a layer – a process called **digitising** – which we will look at more "
#~ "closely in a later tutorial. If a layer contains polygons (e.g. farm dams), "
#~ "the GIS application will only allow you to create new polygons in that "
#~ "layer. Similarly if you want to change the shape of a feature, the "
#~ "application will only allow you to do it if the changed shape is correct. "
#~ "For example it won't allow you to edit a line in such a way that it has only"
#~ " one vertex – remember in our discussion of lines above that all lines must "
#~ "have at least two vertices."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As well as creating your own data, there is a lot of free vector data that "
#~ "you can obtain and use. For example, you can obtain vector data that appears"
#~ " on the 1:50 000 map sheets from the Chief Directorate : Surveys and "
#~ "Mapping."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Scale and vector data:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Map **scale** is an important issue to consider when working with vector "
#~ "data in a GIS. When data is captured, it is usually digitised from existing "
#~ "maps, or by taking information from surveyor records and global positioning "
#~ "system devices. Maps have different scales, so if you import vector data "
#~ "from a map into a GIS environment (for example by digitising paper maps), "
#~ "the digital vector data will have the same scale issues as the original map."
#~ " This effect can be seen in Illustrations  and  . Many issues can arise from"
#~ " making a poor choice of map scale. For example using the vector data in "
#~ "Illustration  ) to plan a wetland conservation area could result in "
#~ "important parts of the wetland being left out of the reserve! On the other "
#~ "hand if you are trying to create a regional map, using data captured at "
#~ "1:1000 000 might be just fine and will save you a lot of time and effort "
#~ "capturing the data."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Symbology:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When you add vector layers to the map view in a GIS application, they will "
#~ "be drawn with random colours and basic symbols. One of the great advantages "
#~ "of using a GIS is that you can create personalised maps very easily. The GIS"
#~ " program will let you choose colours to suite the feature type (e.g. you can"
#~ " tell it to draw a water bodies vector layer in blue). The GIS will also let"
#~ " you adjust the symbol used. So if you have a trees point layer, you can "
#~ "show each tree position with a small picture of a tree, rather than the "
#~ "basic circle marker that the GIS uses when you first load the layer (see "
#~ "Illustrations , &  )."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Symbology is a powerful feature, making maps come to life and the data in "
#~ "your GIS easier to understand. In the topic that follows (working with "
#~ "attribute data) we will explore more deeply how symbology can help the user "
#~ "to understand vector data."
