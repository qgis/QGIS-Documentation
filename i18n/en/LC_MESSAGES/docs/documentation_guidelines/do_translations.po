"This manual is aiming to help the translator. First the general process "
"of how technically a translation is done is explained. Later the "
"translation is explained from an actual English rst document that is "
"translated to Dutch. Finally a summary of :ref:`Rules of translation "
"<translation_summary>` is given."

"When you want to contribute, first get a ``.po`` file and add "

"translated output."

"When afterwards an rst document is updated a new ``.po`` file is created "
"in the english part. The contents of this new file will be merged with "
"already existing ``.po`` files for each language. This means that when a "
"new line is added to an rst document that was already translated, only "
"the new/updated sentences are added in the translated ``.po`` file and "
"needs to be translated. The amount of work for updating translations for "
"next versions of QGIS should be relative small."
