"Background processing using threads is a way to maintain a responsive "

"A task (:class:`QgsTask <qgis.core.QgsTask>`) is a container for the code"
" to be performed in the background, and the task manager "
"(:class:`QgsTaskManager <qgis.core.QgsTaskManager>`) is used to control "
"the running of the tasks. These classes simplify background processing in"
" QGIS by providing mechanisms for signaling, progress reporting and "
"access to the status for background processes. Tasks can be grouped using"
" subtasks."

"The global task manager (found with :meth:`QgsApplication.taskManager() "
"<qgis.core.QgsApplication.taskManager>`) is normally used.  This means "
"that your tasks may not be the only tasks that are controlled by the task"
" manager."

"Any background task (regardless of how it is created) must NEVER perform "

"Dependencies between tasks can be described using the ``addSubTask`` "
"function of :class:`QgsTask <qgis.core.QgsTask>`. When a dependency is "
"stated, the task manager will automatically determine how these "
"dependencies will be executed. Wherever possible dependencies will be "
"executed in parallel in order to satisfy them as quickly as possible. If "
"a task on which another task depends is canceled, the dependent task will"
" also be canceled. Circular dependencies can make deadlocks possible, so "
"be careful."

"Once the task has been created it can be scheduled for running using the "
"``addTask`` function of the task manager. Adding a task to the manager "
"automatically transfers ownership of that task to the manager, and the "
"manager will cleanup and delete tasks after they have executed. The "
"scheduling of the tasks is influenced by the task priority, which is set "
"in ``addTask``."
