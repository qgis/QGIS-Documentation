"Depending on the kind of plugin that you are going to develop, it might "
"be better option to add its functionality as a Processing algorithm (or a"
" set of them). That would provide a better integration within QGIS, "
"additional functionality (since it can be run in the components of "
"Processing, such as the modeler or the batch processing interface), and a"
" quicker development time (since Processing will take of a large part of "
"the work)."
