"A raster layer consists of one or more raster bands --- it is referred to"
" as either single band or multi band raster. One band represents a matrix"
" of values. Usual color image (e.g. aerial photo) is a raster consisting "
"of red, blue and green band. Single band layers typically represent "
"either continuous variables (e.g. elevation) or discrete variables (e.g. "
"land use). In some cases, a raster layer comes with a palette and raster "
"values refer to colors stored in the palette:"
