"You can do transformation between different spatial reference systems by "
"using :class:`QgsCoordinateTransform` class. The easiest way to use it is"
" to create source and destination CRS and construct "
":class:`QgsCoordinateTransform` instance with them. Then just repeatedly "
"call :func:`transform` function to do the transformation. By default it "
"does forward transformation, but it is capable to do also inverse "
"transformation"
