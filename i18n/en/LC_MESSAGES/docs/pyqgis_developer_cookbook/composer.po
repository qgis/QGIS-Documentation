"There are generally two approaches when input data should be rendered as a "
"map: either do it quick way using :class:`QgsMapRenderer` or produce more "
"fine-tuned output by composing the map with :class:`QgsComposition` class "
"and friends."

"Map composer is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "
"sophisticated output than the simple rendering shown above. Using the "
"composer it is possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map "
"views, labels, legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on"
" paper maps. The layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or "
"directly printed on a printer."

"Note that the composition takes an instance of :class:`QgsMapRenderer`. In "
"the code we expect we are running within QGIS application and thus use the "
"map renderer from map canvas. The composition uses various parameters from "
"the map renderer, most importantly the default set of map layers and the "
"current extent. When using composer in a standalone application, you can "
"create your own map renderer instance the same way as shown in the section "
"above and pass it to the composition."
