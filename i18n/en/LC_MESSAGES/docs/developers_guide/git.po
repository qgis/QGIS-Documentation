msgid ""
"The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during "
"the last years. Therefore it is hard to anticipate the side effects that "
"the addition of a feature will have. In the past, the QGIS project had "
"very long release cycles because it was a lot of work to reetablish the "
"stability of the software system after new features were added. To "
"overcome these problems, QGIS switched to a development model where new "
"features are coded in GIT branches first and merged to master (the main "
"branch) when they are finished and stable. This section describes the "
"procedure for branching and merging in the QGIS project."

"Before starting, make an announcement on the developer mailing list to "
"see if another developer is already working on the same feature. Also "
"contact the technical advisor of the project steering committee (PSC). If"
" the new feature requires any changes to the QGIS architecture, a request"
" for comment (RFC) is needed."

"Now you can start developing. If you plan to do extensive on that branch,"
" would like to share the work with other developers, and have write "

"Rebase to master regularly: It is recommended to rebase to incorporate "
