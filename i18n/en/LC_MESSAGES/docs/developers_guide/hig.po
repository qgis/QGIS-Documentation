"In order for all graphical user interface elements to appear consistent "
"and to all the user to instinctively use dialogs, it is important that "
"the following guidelines are followed in layout and design of GUIs."

"Group related elements using group boxes: Try to identify elements that "
"can be grouped together and then use group boxes with a label to identify"
" the topic of that group. Avoid using group boxes with only a single "
"widget / item inside."

msgid ""
"Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and "
"other non-heading or title text: These should be written as a phrase with"
" leading capital letter, and all remaining words written with lower case "
"first letters, unless they are nouns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Capitalize all words in Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so"
" on), Functions (menu items, buttons), and other selectable items "
"(combobox items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on): Capitalize "
"all words, except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for "
"example, 'with' but 'Without'), conjunctions (for example, and, or, but),"
" and articles (a, an, the). However, always capitalize the first and last"
" word."

msgid ""
"Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon"
" causes visual noise and does not impart additional meaning, so don't use"
" them. An exception to this rule is when you have two labels next to each"
" other e.g.: Label1 Plugin (Path:) Label2 [/path/to/plugins]"

"Keep harmful actions away from harmless ones: If you have actions for "
"'delete', 'remove' etc, try to impose adequate space between the harmful "
"action and innocuous actions so that the users is less likely to "
"inadvertently click on the harmful action."

"Always use a QButtonBox for 'OK', 'Cancel' etc buttons: Using a button "

"the user is using."

"Tabs should not be nested. If you use tabs, follow the style of the tabs "

"Widget stacks should be avoided if at all possible. They cause problems "

"Separate advanced options from basic ones. Novice users should be able to"
" quickly access the items needed for basic activities without needing to "
"concern themselves with complexity of advanced features. Advanced "
"features should either be located below a dividing line, or placed onto a"
" separate tab."
