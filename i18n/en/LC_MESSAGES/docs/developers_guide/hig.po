"In order for all graphical user interface elements to appear consistant "
"and to all the user to instinctively use dialogs, it is important that "
"the following guidelines are followed in layout and design of GUIs."

"Group related elements using group boxes: Try to identify elements that "
"can be grouped together and then use group boxes with a label to identify"
" the topic of that group. Avoid using group boxes with only a single "
"widget / item inside."
msgstr ""

"Capitalise first letter only in labels: Labels (and group box labels) "
"should be written as a phrase with leading capital letter, and all "
"remaining words written with lower case first letters"

#: ../../source/docs/developers_guide/hig.rst:21
msgid ""
"Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon"
" causes visual noise and does not impart additional meaning, so don't use"
" them. An exception to this rule is when you have two labels next to each"
" other e.g.: Label1 Plugin (Path:) Label2 [/path/to/plugins]"

"Always use a QButtonBox for 'OK', 'Cancel' etc buttons: Using a button "

"the user is using."

"Tabs should not be nested. If you use tabs, follow the style of the tabs "

"Widget stacks should be avoided if at all possible. They cause problems "
"with layouts and inexplicable (to the user) resizing of dialogs to "
"accommodate widgets that are not visible."

msgid ""
"Try to avoid technical terms and rather use a laymans equivalent e.g. use"

" 'Text' instead of 'String' and so on."

"Separate advanced options from basic ones. Novice users should be able to"

"features should either be located below a dividing line, or placed onto a"
" separate tab."
