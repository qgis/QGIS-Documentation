"**Spatial analysis** is the process of manipulating spatial information "
"to extract new information and meaning from the original data. Usually "
"spatial analysis is carried out with a Geographic Information System "
"(GIS). A GIS usually provides spatial analysis tools for calculating "
"feature statistics and carrying out geoprocessing activities as data "
"interpolation. In hydrology, users will likely emphasize the importance "
"of terrain analysis and hydrological modelling (modelling the movement of"
" water over and in the earth). In wildlife management, users are "
"interested in analytical functions dealing with wildlife point locations "
"and their relationship to the environment. Each user will have different "
"things they are interested in depending on the kind of work they do."

"Spatial interpolation is the process of using points with known values to"
" estimate values at other unknown points. For example, to make a "
"precipitation (rainfall) map for your country, you will not find enough "
"evenly spread weather stations to cover the entire region. Spatial "
"interpolation can estimate the temperatures at locations without recorded"
" data by using known temperature readings at nearby weather stations (see"
" figure_temperature_map_). This type of interpolated surface is often "
"called a **statistical surface**. Elevation data, precipitation, snow "
"accumulation, water table and population density are other types of data "
"that can be computed using interpolation."

"Because of high cost and limited resources, data collection is usually "
"conducted only in a limited number of selected point locations. In GIS, "
"spatial interpolation of these points can be applied to create a raster "
"surface with estimates made for all raster cells."

msgid ""
"In order to generate a continuous map, for example, a digital elevation "
"map from elevation points measured with a GPS device, a suitable "
"interpolation method has to be used to optimally estimate the values at "
"those locations where no samples or measurements were taken. The results "
"of the interpolation analysis can then be used for analyses that cover "
"the whole area and for modelling."

"There are many interpolation methods. In this introduction we will "

"Weighting is assigned to sample points through the use of a weighting "
"coefficient that controls how the weighting influence will drop off as "
"the distance from new point increases. The greater the weighting "
"coefficient, the less the effect points will have if they are far from "
"the unknown point during the interpolation process. As the coefficient "
"increases, the value of the unknown point approaches the value of the "
"nearest observational point."

msgid ""
"It is important to notice that the IDW interpolation method also has some"
" disadvantages: the quality of the interpolation result can decrease, if "
"the distribution of sample data points is uneven. Furthermore, maximum "
"and minimum values in the interpolated surface can only occur at sample "
"data points. This often results in small peaks and pits around the sample"
" data points as shown in figure_idw_interpolation_."

"TIN interpolation is another popular tool in GIS. A common TIN algorithm "
"is called **Delaunay triangulation**. It tries to create a surface formed"
" by triangles of nearest neighbour points. To do this, circumcircles "
"around selected sample points are created and their intersections are "
"connected to a network of non overlapping and as compact as possible "
"triangles (see figure_tin_interpolation_)."

"The main disadvantage of the TIN interpolation is that the surfaces are "
"not smooth and may give a jagged appearance. This is caused by "
"discontinuous slopes at the triangle edges and sample data points. In "
"addition, triangulation is generally not suitable for extrapolation "
"beyond the area with collected sample data points (see figure_tin_result_"

"It is important to remember that there is no single interpolation method "
"that can be applied to all situations. Some are more exact and useful "

"method should depend upon the sample data, the type of surfaces to be "
