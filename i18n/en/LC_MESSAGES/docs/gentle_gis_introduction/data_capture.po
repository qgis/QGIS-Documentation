"position of fire assembly points, the layout of each class room, and so "

" into groups and assign each group a few features to capture. Have them "

"If you don't have a computer available, you can follow the same process "

"orthosheet or satellite image printout as your background layer. Draw "
"columns down the page in your notebook and write in the column headings "

"the geometry of features onto the transparency sheet, writing a number "
"next to each feature so that it can be identified. Now write the same "
