"**Topology** expresses the spatial relationships between connecting or "
"adjacent vector features (points, polylines and polygons) in a GIS. "
"Topological or topology-based data are useful for detecting and "
"correcting digitising errors (e.g. two lines in a roads vector layer that"
" do not meet perfectly at an intersection). Topology is necessary for "
"carrying out some types of spatial analysis, such as network analysis."

"Imagine you travel to London. On a sightseeing tour you plan to visit St."
" Paul's Cathedral first and in the afternoon Covent Garden Market for "
"some souvenirs. Looking at the Underground map of London (see "
"figure_topology_london_) you have to find connecting trains to get from "
"Covent Garden to St. Paul's. This requires topological information (data)"
" about where it is possible to change trains. Looking at a map of the "
"underground, the topological relationships are illustrated by circles "

"There are different types of topological errors and they can be grouped "
"according to whether the vector feature types are polygons or polylines. "
"Topological errors with **polygon** features can include unclosed "
"polygons, gaps between polygon borders or overlapping polygon borders. A "
"common topological error with **polyline** features is that they do not "
"meet perfectly at a point (node). This type of error is called an "
"**undershoot** if a gap exists between the lines, and an **overshoot** if"
" a line ends beyond the line it should connect to (see "
"figure_topology_errors_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/topology.rst:61
msgid ""
"Undershoots (1) occur when digitised vector lines that should connect to "
"each other donâ€™t quite touch. Overshoots (2) happen if a line ends beyond"
" the line it should connect to. Slivers (3) occur when the vertices of "
"two polygons do not match up on their borders."

#: ../../source/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/topology.rst:66

"The result of overshoot and undershoot errors are so-called 'dangling "

"Topological errors break the relationship between features. These errors "
"need to be fixed in order to be able to analyse vector data with "
"procedures like network analysis (e.g. finding the best route across a "
"road network) or measurement (e.g. finding out the length of a river). In"
" addition to topology being useful for network analysis and measurement, "
"there are other reasons why it is important and useful to create or have "
"vector data with correct topology. Just imagine you digitise a municipal "
"boundaries map for your province and the polygons overlap or show "
"slivers. If such errors were present, you would be able to use the "
"measurement tools, but the results you get will be incorrect. You will "
"not know the correct area for any municipality and you will not be able "
"to define exactly, where the borders between the municipalities are."

"Many GIS applications provide tools for topological editing. For example "
"in QGIS you can **enable topological editing** to improve editing and "
"maintaining common boundaries in polygon layers. A GIS such as QGIS "
"'detects' a shared boundary in a polygon map so you only have to move the"

"Another topological option allows you to prevent** polygon overlaps** "

"Snapping distance is the distance a GIS uses to search for the closest "

"**segment** is a straight line formed between two vertices in a polygon "

"Snapping distance and search radius are both set in map units so you may "

"value that is too big, the GIS may snap to a wrong vertex, especially if "

"specify the search radius too small the GIS application won't find any "
