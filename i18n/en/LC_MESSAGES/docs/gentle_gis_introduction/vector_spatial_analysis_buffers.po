"**Spatial analysis** uses spatial information to extract new and "
"additional meaning from GIS data. Usually spatial analysis is carried out"
" using a GIS Application. GIS Applications normally have spatial analysis"
" tools for feature statistics (e.g. how many vertices make up this "
"polyline?) or geoprocessing such as feature buffering. The types of "
"spatial analysis that are used vary according to subject areas. People "
"working in water management and research (hydrology) will most likely be "
"interested in analysing terrain and modelling water as it moves across "
"it. In wildlife management users are interested in analytical functions "
"that deal with wildlife point locations and their relationship to the "
"environment. In this topic we will discuss buffering as an example of a "
"useful spatial analysis that can be carried out with vector data."

"**Buffering** usually creates two areas: one area that is **within** a "
"specified distance to selected real world features and the other area "
"that is **beyond**. The area that is within the specified distance is "

"A **buffer zone** is any area that serves the purpose of keeping real "
"world features distant from one another. Buffer zones are often set up to"
" protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from "
"industrial accidents or natural disasters, or to prevent violence. Common"
" types of buffer zones may be greenbelts between residential and "
"commercial areas, border zones between countries (see "
"figure_buffer_zone_), noise protection zones around airports, or "
"pollution protection zones along rivers."
