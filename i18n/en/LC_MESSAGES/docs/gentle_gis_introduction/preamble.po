"GIS is becoming an increasingly important tool in environmental "
"management, retail, military, police, tourism and many other spheres of "
"our daily lives. If you use a computer or a cell phone, you have probably"
" already used a GIS in some form without even realising it. Maybe it was "
"a map on a web site, Google Earth, an information booth or your cell "
"phone telling you where you are. Proprietary GIS software (software that "
"cannot be freely shared or modified) is available that will let you do "
"everything we describe in these worksheets and a lot more. However this "
"software is usually very expensive or otherwise limits your freedom to "
"copy, share and modify the software. GIS vendors sometimes make an "
"exception for educational activities, providing cheaper or free copies of"
" their software. They do this knowing that if teachers and learners get "
"to know their software, they will be reluctant to learn other packages. "
"When learners leave school they will go into the workplace and buy the "
"commercial software, never knowing that there are free alternatives that "
"they could be using."

"With QGIS, we offer an alternative --- software that is free of cost and "
"free in a social sense. You can make as many copies as you like. When "
"learners leave school one day they can use this software to build their "
"skills, solve problems at work and make the world a better place."

"When you buy commercial software, you limit your options for the future. "
"By learning, using and sharing Free and Open Source Software, you are "
"building your own skills, freeing money to be spent on important things "
"like food and shelter and boosting our own economy."
