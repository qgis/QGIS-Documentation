"Now that we have described what vector data is, let's look at how vector "

"attributes (e.g. information about what species a tree is for a trees "
"layer). For example if you have recorded the positions of all the "
"footpaths in your school, they will usually be stored together on the "
"computer hard disk and shown in the GIS as a single layer. This is "

"farm dams), the GIS application will only allow you to create new "
"polygons in that layer. Similarly if you want to change the shape of a "
"feature, the application will only allow you to do it if the changed "
"shape is correct. For example it won't allow you to edit a line in such a"
" way that it has only one vertex â€“-- remember in our discussion of lines "

"Creating and editing vector data is an important function of a GIS since "
"it is one of the main ways in which you can create personal data for "

"pollution in a river. You could use the GIS to digitise all outfalls for "
"storm water drains (as point features). You could also digitise the river"

"Map **scale** is an important issue to consider when working with vector "
"data in a GIS. When data is captured, it is usually digitised from "
"existing maps, or by taking information from surveyor records and global "
"positioning system devices. Maps have different scales, so if you import "
"vector data from a map into a GIS environment (for example by digitising "
"paper maps), the digital vector data will have the same scale issues as "
"the original map. This effect can be seen in illustrations "
"figure_vector_small_scale_ and figure_vector_large_scale_. Many issues "
"can arise from making a poor choice of map scale. For example using the "
"vector data in illustration figure_vector_small_scale_ to plan a wetland "
"conservation area could result in important parts of the wetland being "
"left out of the reserve! On the other hand if you are trying to create a "
"regional map, using data captured at 1:1000 000 might be just fine and "

"When you add vector layers to the map view in a GIS application, they "
