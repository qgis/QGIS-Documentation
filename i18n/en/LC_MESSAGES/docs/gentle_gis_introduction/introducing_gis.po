"You can see an example of what a **GIS Application** looks like "

"window (File, Edit etc.) which, when clicked using the mouse, show a "

"example, our health care worker could store the person's age and gender "
"on her table. When the GIS Application draws the layer, you can tell it "
"to draw the layer based on gender, or based on disease type, and so on. "
