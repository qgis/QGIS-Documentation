"GRASS integration provides access to GRASS GIS databases and "
"functionalities (see GRASS-PROJECT in :ref:`literature_and_web`). The "
"integration consists of two parts: provider and plugin. The provider "
"allows to browse, manage and visualize GRASS raster and vector layers. "
"The plugin can be used to create new GRASS locations and mapsets, change "
"GRASS region, create and edit vector layers and analyze GRASS 2-D and 3-D"
" data with more than 400 GRASS modules. In this section, we'll introduce "
"the provider and plugin functionalities and give some examples of "
"managing and working with GRASS data."

" same time (binaries have different file names). Only one version of the "

"Several methods are used to display elevation layers and give a 3-D "
"effect to maps. The use of contour lines, as shown above, is one popular "
"method often chosen to produce topographic maps. Another way to display a"
" 3-D effect is by hillshading. The hillshade effect is created from a DEM"
" (elevation) raster by first calculating the slope and aspect of each "
"cell, then simulating the sun's position in the sky and giving a "
"reflectance value to each cell. Thus, you get sun-facing slopes lighted; "
"the slopes facing away from the sun (in shadow) are darkened."
