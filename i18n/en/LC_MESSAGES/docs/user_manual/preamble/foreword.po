"QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was "
"born in May of 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in "
"June of the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software (which is "
"traditionally expensive proprietary software) a viable prospect for "
"anyone with basic access to a personal computer. QGIS currently runs on "
"most Unix platforms, Windows, and macOS. QGIS is developed using the Qt "
"toolkit (https://www.qt.io) and C++.  This means that QGIS feels snappy "
"and has a pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)."

"QGIS aims to be a user-friendly GIS, providing common functions and "
"features.  The initial goal of the project was to provide a GIS data "
"viewer. QGIS has reached the point in its evolution where it is being "
"used by many for their daily GIS data-viewing needs. QGIS supports a "
"number of raster and vector data formats, with new format support easily "
"added using the plugin architecture."
