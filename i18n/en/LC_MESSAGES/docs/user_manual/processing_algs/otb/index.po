"`Orfeo ToolBox <http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/>`_ (OTB) is an open "
"source library of image processing algorithms. OTB is based on the "
"medical image processing library ITK and offers particular "
"functionalities for remote sensing image processing in general and for "
"high spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted algorithms for "
"high resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, "
"Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, "
"ERS, Palsar) are available."
