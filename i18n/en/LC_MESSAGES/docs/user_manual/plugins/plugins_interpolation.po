"The Interpolation plugin can be used to generate a TIN or IDW "
"interpolation of a point vector layer. It is very simple to handle and "
"provides an intuitive graphical user interface for creating interpolated "
"raster layers (see Figure_interpolation_). The plugin requires the "
"following parameters to be specified before running:"

"Input **Vector layers**: Specify the input point vector layer(s) from a "
"list of loaded point layers. If several layers are specified, then data "
"from all layers is used for interpolation. Note: It is possible to insert"
" lines or polygons as constraints for the triangulation, by specifying "
"either \"points\", \"structure lines\" or \"break lines\" in the "
":guilabel:`Type` |selectString| combo box."

"**Interpolation Method**: Select the interpolation method. This can be "
"either 'Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)' or 'Inverse Distance "
"Weighted (IDW)'. With the TIN method you can create a surface formed by "
"triangles of nearest neighbor points. To do this, circumcircles around "
"selected sample points are created and their intersections are connected "
"to a network of non overlapping and as compact as possible triangles. The"
" resulting surfaces are not smooth. When using the IDW method the sample "
"points are weighted during interpolation such that the influence of one "
"point relative to another declines with distance from the unknown point "
"you want to create. The IDW interpolation method also has some "
"disadvantages: the quality of the interpolation result can decrease, if "
"the distribution of sample data points is uneven. Furthermore, maximum "
"and minimum values in the interpolated surface can only occur at sample "
"data points. This often results in small peaks and pits around the sample"
" data points."

"|options| **Configure Interpolation Method**: Configure the interpolation"

"triangulation in shapefile format. For IDW interpolation you can set the "
"distance coefficient."

"Note that using lines as constraints for the interpolation the "
"triangulation (TIN method) you can either use 'structure lines' or 'break"

" while using 'structure lines' you produce continuous breaks. The "
"triangulation is modified by both methods such that no edge crosses a "
"breakline or structure line."
