"**Interpolation Method**: Select the interpolation method. This can be "
"either 'Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)' or 'Inverse Distance Weighted "
"(IDW)'. With the TIN method you can create a surface formed by triangles of "
"nearest neighbour points. To do this, circumcircles around selected sample "
"points are created and their intersections are connected to a network of non"
" overlapping and as compact as possible triangles. The resulting surfaces "
"are not smooth. When using the IDW method the sample points are weighted "
"during interpolation such that the influence of one point relative to "
"another declines with distance from the unknown point you want to create. "
"The IDW interpolation method also has some disadvantages: the quality of the"
" interpolation result can decrease, if the distribution of sample data "
"points is uneven. Furthermore, maximum and minimum values in the "
"interpolated surface can only occur at sample data points. This often "
"results in small peaks and pits around the sample data points."

"Note that using lines as constraints for the interpolation the triangulation"

"using 'break lines' you produce sharp breaks in the surface while using "
"'structure lines' you produce continous breaks. The triangulation is "
"modified by both methods such that no edge crosses a breakline or structure "
"line."
