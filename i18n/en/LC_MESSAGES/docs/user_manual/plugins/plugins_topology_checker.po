"Topology describes the relationships between points, lines and polygons "
"that represent the features of a geographic region. With the Topology "
"Checker plugin, you can look over your vector files and check the "
"topology with several topology rules. These rules check with spatial "
"relations whether your features 'Equal', 'Contain', 'Cover', are "
"'CoveredBy', 'Cross', are 'Disjoint', 'Intersect', 'Overlap', 'Touch' or "
"are 'Within' each other. It depends on your individual questions which "
"topology rules you apply to your vector data (e.g., normally you won't "
"accept overshoots in line layers, but if they depict dead-end streets you"
" won't remove them from your vector layer)."

"QGIS has a built-in topological editing feature, which is great for "
