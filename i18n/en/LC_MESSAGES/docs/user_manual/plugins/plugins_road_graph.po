"The Road Graph Plugin is a C++ plugin for QGIS that calculates the "

"As a roads layer, you can use any polyline vector layer in any QGIS-"
"supported format. Two lines with a common point are considered connected."
" Please note, it is required to use layer CRS as project CRS while "
"editing a roads layer. This is due to the fact that recalculation of the "
"coordinates between different CRSs introduces some errors that can result"
" in discontinuities, even when 'snapping' is used."
