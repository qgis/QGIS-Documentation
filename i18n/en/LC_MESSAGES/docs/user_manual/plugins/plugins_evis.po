"The Event Browser module provides the functionality to display geocoded "
"photographs that are linked to vector features displayed in the QGIS map "
"window. Point data, for example, can be from a vector file that can be input "
"using QGIS or it can be from the result of a database query. The vector "
"feature must have attribute information associated with it to describe the "
"location and name of the file containing the photograph and, optionally, the "
"compass direction the camera was pointed when the image was acquired. Your "
"vector layer must be loaded into QGIS before running the Event Browser."
