"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of the QGIS core and is intended"
" to be the main tool to integrate and manage spatial database formats "
"supported by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite, GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial, "
"Virtual layers) in one user interface. The |dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` "
"Plugin provides several features. You can drag layers from the QGIS "
"Browser into the DB Manager, and it will import your layer into your "
"spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between spatial databases "
"and they will get imported."

"The :menuselection:`Database` menu allows you to connect to an existing "
"database, to start the SQL window and to exit the DB Manager Plugin. Once"
" you are connected to an existing database, the menus "
":menuselection:`Schema` and :menuselection:`Table` additionally appear."

"The :menuselection:`Table` menu allows you to create and edit tables and "
"to delete tables and views. It is also possible to empty tables and to "
"move tables from one schema to another. As further functionality, you can"
" perform a VACUUM and then an ANALYZE for each selected table. Plain "
"VACUUM simply reclaims space and makes it available for reuse. ANALYZE "
"updates statistics to determine the most efficient way to execute a "
"query. Finally, you can import layers/files, if they are loaded in QGIS "
"or exist in the file system. And you can export database tables to shape "
"with the Export File feature."

"The :guilabel:`Tree` window lists all existing databases supported by "

"menu."

"If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers "
"three tabs. The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table"
" and its geometry, as well as about existing fields, constraints and "
"indexes. It also allows you to run Vacuum Analyze and to create a spatial"
" index on a selected table, if not already done. The :guilabel:`Table` "
"tab shows all attributes, and the :guilabel:`Preview` tab renders the "
"geometries as preview."

"You can also use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your "
