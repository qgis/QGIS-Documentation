"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of |qg| core and intends to replace "
"the SPIT Plugin and the PostGIS Manager Plugin and additionally to integrate "
"all other database formats supported by |qg| in one user interface. The |"
"icon_dbmanager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can "
"drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager and it will import "
"your layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between "
"spatial databases and they will get imported. You can also use the DB "
"Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view "
"the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS as a query "
"layer."

"The :menuselection:`Database` menu allows to connect to an existing "
"database, to start the SQL-window and to exit the DB Manager Plugin. The :"
"menuselection:`Schema` menu includes tools to create and delete (empty) "
"schemas and, if topology is available (e.g. PostGIS 2) to start a :guilabel:"
"`TopoViewer`. The menu :menuselection:`Table` allows to create and edit "
"tables and to delete tables and views. It is also possible to empty tables "
"and to move tables from one to another schema. Finally you can also run "
"Vacuum Analyze and add Versioning Support to a table."

"If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers "
"three tabs. The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table "
"and its geometry as well as about existing Fields, Constraints and Indexes. "
"It also allows to run Vacuum Analyze and to create a spatial index on a "
"selected table, if not already done. The :guilabel:`Table` tab shows all "
"attributes and the :guilabel:`Preview` tab renders the geometries as preview."
