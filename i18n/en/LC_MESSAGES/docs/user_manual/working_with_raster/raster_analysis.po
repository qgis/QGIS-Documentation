"The :menuselection:`Raster Calculator` in the :menuselection:`Raster` "

"The **Raster bands** list contains all loaded raster layers that can be "

"In the **Result layer** section, you will need to define an output layer."

"Conditional expressions (``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>=``, ... ) return "
"either 0 for false or 1 for true, and therefore can be used with other "
