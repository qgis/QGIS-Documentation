"The :guilabel:`Metadata` tab displays a wealth of information about the "

"layer. From this tab, entries may be made for the "
":guilabel:`Description`, :guilabel:`Attribution`, :guilabel:`MetadataUrl`"
" and :guilabel:`Properties`. In :guilabel:`Properties`, statistics are "
"gathered on a 'need to know' basis, so it may well be that a given "
