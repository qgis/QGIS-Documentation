"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that "
"allows anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere "
"in the world. GPS is used as an aid in navigation, for example in "
"airplanes, in boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from"
" the satellites to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) "
"elevation. Most receivers also have the capability to store locations "
"(known as **waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned "
"**route** and a tracklog or **track** of the receiver's movement over "
"time. Waypoints, routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in "
"GPS data. QGIS displays waypoints in point layers, while routes and "
"tracks are displayed in linestring layers."
