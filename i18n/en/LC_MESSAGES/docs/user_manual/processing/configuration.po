"As has been mentioned, the configuration menu gives access to a new "
"dialog where you can configure how algorithms work. Configuration "
"parameters are structured in separate blocks that you can select on the "

"Along with the aforementioned :guilabel:`Output folder` entry, the "
":guilabel:`General` block contains parameters for setting the default "
"rendering style for output layers (that is, layers generated by using "
"algorithms from any of the framework GUI components). Just create the "
"style you want using QGIS, save it to a file, and then enter the path to "
"that file in the settings so the algorithms can use it. Whenever a layer "
"is loaded by Processing and added to the QGIS canvas, it will be rendered"
" with that style."

"Rendering styles can be configured individually for each algorithm and "
"each one of its outputs. Just right-click on the name of the algorithm in"
" the toolbox and select :guilabel:`Edit rendering styles for outputs`. "
"You will see a dialog like the one shown next."

":guilabel:`Use filename as layer name`. The name of each resulting layer "
"created by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm itself. In some "
"cases, a fixed name might be used, meaning that the same output name will"
" be used, no matter which input layer is used. In other cases, the name "
"might depend on the name of the input layer or some of the parameters "
"used to run the algorithm. If this checkbox is checked, the name will be "
"taken from the output filename instead. Notice that, if the output is "
"saved to a temporary file, the filename of this temporary file is usually"
" a long and meaningless one intended to avoid collision with other "
"already existing filenames."

":guilabel:`Keep dialog open after running algorithm`. Once an algorithm "
"has finished execution and its output layers are loaded into the QGIS "
"project, the algorithm dialog is closed. If you want to keep it open (to "
"run the algorithm again with different parameters, or to better check the"
" output that is written to the log tab), check this option"

":guilabel:`Use only selected features`. If this option is selected, "

"Apart from the :guilabel:`General` block in the settings dialog, you will"
" also find a block for algorithm providers. Each entry in this block "
"contains an :guilabel:`Activate` item that you can use to make algorithms"
" appear or not in the toolbox. Also, some algorithm providers have their "
"own configuration items, which we will explain later when covering "
"particular algorithm providers."
