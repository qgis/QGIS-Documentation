"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is "
"stored in the history manager. Along with the parameters used, the date "
"and time of the execution are also saved."

"This way, it is easy to track and control all the work that has been "
"developed using the Processing framework, and to reproduce it."

"The history manager is a set of registry entries grouped according to "
"their date of execution, making it easier to find information about an "
"algorithm executed at any particular moment."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for "
"those learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call"
" an algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see"
" how that same algorithm could be called from the command line."

"The history dialog only contains the execution calls, but not the "
"information produced by the algorithm when executed. That information is "
"written to the QGIS log, in a :guilabel:`Processing` tab."

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by calling their command-line"
" interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although "
"that console is not shown, usually a full dump of it is written to the "
"log each time you run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the "
"log with that information, you can disable it for each provider, looking "
"for the corresponding option in the provider entry of the settings "
"dialog."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "
"data, might add comments or additional information to log if they detect "
"potential problems with the data, in order to warn you. Make sure you "
"check those messages in the log if you are having unexpected results."
