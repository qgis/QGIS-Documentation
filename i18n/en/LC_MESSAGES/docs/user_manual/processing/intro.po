"This chapter introduces the QGIS processing framework, a geoprocessing "
"environment that can be used to call native and third-party algorithms "
"from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks more productive and easy to"
" accomplish."

"There are four basic elements in the framework GUI, which are used to run"
" algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another will "
"depend on the kind of analysis that is to be performed and the particular"
" characteristics of each user and project. All of them (except for the "
"batch processing interface, which is called from the toolbox or the "
"algorithm execution dialog, as we will see) can be accessed from the "
":menuselection:`Processing` menu item. (You will see more than four "
"entries. The remaining ones are not used to execute algorithms and will "
"be explained later in this chapter)."
