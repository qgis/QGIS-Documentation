"You can create your own algorithms by writing the corresponding Python "
"code and adding a few extra lines to supply additional information needed"
" to define the semantics of the algorithm. You can find a "
":guilabel:`Create new script` menu under the :guilabel:`Tools` group in "
"the :guilabel:`Script` algorithms block of the toolbox. Double-click on "
"it to open the script edition dialog. That's where you should type your "
"code. Saving the script from there in the :file:`scripts` folder (the "
"default one when you open the save file dialog), with :file:`.py` "
"extension, will automatically create the corresponding algorithm."
