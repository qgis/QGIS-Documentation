"QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (coordinate "
"reference system) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows "
"the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-"
"the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All of these "
"features allow the user to display layers with different CRSs and have "
"them overlay properly."

"QGIS has support for approximately 2,700 known CRSs. Definitions for each"
" CRS are stored in a SQLite database that is installed with QGIS. "
"Normally, you do not need to manipulate the database directly. In fact, "
"doing so may cause projection support to fail. Custom CRSs are stored in "
"a user database. See section :ref:`sec_custom_projections` for "
"information on managing your custom coordinate reference systems."

"The CRSs available in QGIS are based on those defined by the European "
"Petroleum Search Group (EPSG) and the Institut Geographique National de "
"France (IGNF) and are largely abstracted from the spatial reference "
"tables used in GDAL. EPSG identifiers are present in the database and can"
" be used to specify a CRS in QGIS."

msgid ""
"In order to use OTF projection, either your data must contain information"
" about its coordinate reference system or you will need to define a "
"global, layer or project-wide CRS. For PostGIS layers, QGIS uses the "
"spatial reference identifier that was specified when the layer was "
"created. For data supported by OGR, QGIS relies on the presence of a "
"recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the case of shapefiles, this "
"means a file containing the well-known text (:index:`WKT`) specification "
"of the CRS. This projection file has the same base name as the shapefile "
"and a :file:`.prj` extension. For example, a shapefile named "
":file:`alaska.shp` would have a corresponding projection file named "
":file:`alaska.prj`."
