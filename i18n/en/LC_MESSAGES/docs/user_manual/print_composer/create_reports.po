"This section will help you set up an automatic report in QGIS. By "
"definition a GIS report is a document containing information organized in"
" a narrative, graphic, maps, or tabular form, prepared on ad hoc, "
"periodic, recurring, regular, or as required basis. Reports may refer to "
"specific periods, events, occurrences, or subjects, locations, and may be"
" communicated or presented in oral or written form. The reports in QGIS "
"will allow the users to output their GIS projects in a simple, quick and "
"structured way."

"QGIS reports can consist of multiple, nested sections. In our new blank "
"report we initially have only the main report section. The only options "
"present for this report section is :guilabel:`Include report header` or "
":guilabel:`Include report footer`. If we enable these options, the header"
" will be included as the very first page (or pages… --- individual parts "
"of reports can be multi-page if desired) in the report, and the footer "
"would be the last page. Let’s go ahead and enable the header, and hit the"

"A few things happen as a result. Firstly, an edit pencil is now shown "
"next to the :guilabel:`Report` section in the :guilabel:`Report "
"Organizer`, indicating that the report section is currently being edited "
"in the designer. We also see a new blank page shown in the designer "
"itself, with the small :guilabel:`Report Header` title. In QGIS reports, "
"every component of the report is made up of individual layouts. They can "
"be created and modified using the exact same tools as are available for "
"standard print layouts – so you can use any desired combination of "
"labels, pictures, maps, tables, etc. Let’s add some items to our report "
"header to demonstrate:"

"There are two options: :guilabel:`Add Static Layout Section` and a "
":guilabel:`Field Group Section`.  The :guilabel:`Add Static Layout "
"Section` is a single, static body layout. This can be used to embed "
"static layouts mid-way through a report. Alternatively, a "
":guilabel:`Field Group Section` repeats its body layout for every feature"
" in a layer. The features are sorted by the selected grouping feature "
"(with an option for ascending/descending sort). If a field group section "
"has child sections (e.g. another field group section with a different "
"field, then only features with unique values for the group feature are "
"iterated over. This allows nested reports with different information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:132
msgid ""
"For now we’ll add a Field Group to our report. At its most basic level, "
"you can think of a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` as the equivalent of a"
" :ref:`print atlas <atlas_generation>`. You select a layer to iterate "
"over, and the report will insert a section for each feature found. "
"Selecting the new ::guilabel:`Field Group Section` section reveals a "
"number of new related settings:"

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:143
msgid ""
"In this case we’ve setup our Field Group so that we iterate over all the "
"states from the :guilabel:`Admin Level 1` layer, using the values from "
"the :guilabel:`adm1name` field. The same options for header and footer "
"are present, together with a new option to include a :guilabel:`body` for"
" this section. We’ll do that, and edit the body:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:154
msgid ""
"We’ve setup this body with a map (set to follow the current report "
"feature – just like how a map item in an atlas can follow the current "
"atlas feature), and a label showing the state’s name. If we went ahead "
"and exported our report now, we’d get something like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:165
msgid ""
"First, the report header, then a page for each state, and finally the "
"report footer. So more or less an atlas, but with a header and footer "
"page. Let’s make things more interesting by adding a subsection to our "
"state group. We do this by first selecting the state field group in the "
"organizer, then hitting the |signPlus| :sup:`Field Group Section` button "
"and adding a new :guilabel:`Field Group Section`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:176
msgid ""
"When a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` is iterating over its features, it"
" will automatically filter these features to match the feature attributes"
" from its parent groups. In this case, the subsection we added will "
"iterate over a :guilabel:`Populated Places` layer, including a body "
"section for each place encountered. The magic here is that the "
":guilabel:`Populated Places` layer has an attribute named "
":guilabel:`adm1name`, tagging each place with the state it’s contained "
"within (if you’re lucky your data will already be structured like this – "
"if not, run the Processing :ref:`Join Attributes by Location "
"<qgisjoinattributesbylocation>` algorithm and create your own field). "
"When we export this report, QGIS will grab the first state from the "
":guilabel:`Admin Level 1` layer, and then iterate over all the "
":guilabel:`Populated Places` with a matching :guilabel:`adm1name` value. "
"Here’s what we get:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:194
msgid ""
"Here we created a basic body for the Populated Places group, including a "
"map of the place and a table of some place attributes. So our report is "
"now a report header, a page for each state followed by a page for every "
"populated place within that state, and finally the report footer. If we "
"were to add a header for the Populated Places group, it would be included"
" just before listing the populated places for each state:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:206

"Similarly, a footer for the Populated Places group would be inserted "

msgid ""
"In addition to nested subsections, subsections in a report can also be "
"included consecutively. If we add a second subsection to the `Admin Level"
" 1 group` for :guilabel:`Airports`, then our report will first list ALL "
"the populated places for each state, followed by all the airports within "
"that state, before proceeding to the next state. In this case our report "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:231

"Combining nested and consecutive sections, together with section headers "
"and footers allows for tons of flexibility. For instance, in the below "
"report we add another field group as a child of the main report for the "
":guilabel`Ports` layer. Now, after listing the states together with their"
" populated places and airports, we’ll get a summary list of all the ports"
