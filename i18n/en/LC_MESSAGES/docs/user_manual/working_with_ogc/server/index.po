"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3, WFS 1.0.0 and WCS 1.1.1 "
"implementation that, in addition, implements advanced cartographic "
"features for thematic mapping. QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common "
"Gateway Interface) application written in C++ that works together with a "
"web server (e.g., Apache, Lighttpd). It has Python plugin support "
"allowing for fast and efficient development and deployment of new "
"features. The original development of QGIS Server was funded by the EU "
"projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in Switzerland."

"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map "
"rendering. Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for "
"platform-independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, "
"the QGIS Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both"
" for the server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic "
"rules."

"In the following sections, we will provide a sample configuration to set "
