"A WMS server acts upon requests by the client (e.g., QGIS) for a raster "

"WMS is generically a REST (Representational State Transfer) service "
"rather than a full-blown Web service. As such, you can actually take the "
"URLs generated by QGIS and use them in a web browser to retrieve the same"

"QGIS can also act as a WMTS client. WMTS is an OGC standard for "

"efficient way of distributing data than WMS because with WMTS, the tile "
