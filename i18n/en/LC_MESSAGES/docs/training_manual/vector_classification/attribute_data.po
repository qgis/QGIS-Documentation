"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been "
"influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the "
"land use areas look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at "
"the map, the viewers don't know anything about the roads they are seeing;"
" only that there is a road of a certain shape in a certain area."

"But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on"
" the map also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren't just pictures. They "
"represent not only objects in locations, but also information about those"
" objects."

"You now know how to use the attribute table to see what is actually in "
"the data you're using. Any dataset will only be useful to you if it has "

"need, you can quickly decide if you're able to use a given dataset, or if"
" you need to look for another one that has the required attribute data."
