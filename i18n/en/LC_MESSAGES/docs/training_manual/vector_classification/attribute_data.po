"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been "
"influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the "
"land use areas look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at "
"the map, the viewers don't know anything about the roads they are seeing;"
" only that there is a road of a certain shape in a certain area."

"But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on"
" the map also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren't just pictures. They "
