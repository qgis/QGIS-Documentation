"Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete"
" features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines "
"and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any image. Although it may "
"portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects "
"don't exist as separate objects; rather, they are represented using "
"pixels of various different color values."
