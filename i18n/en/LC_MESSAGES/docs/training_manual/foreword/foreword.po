"In 2008 we launched the :ref:`Gentle Introduction to GIS "
"<gentle_introduction_gis>`, a completely free, open content resource for "
"people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon "
"and new terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and"
" has been a phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to"
" us to tell us how they are using the materials to run University "
"Training Courses, teach themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction"
" is not a software tutorial, but rather aims to be a generic text "
"(although we used QGIS in all examples) for someone learning about GIS. "
"There is also the QGIS manual which provides a detailed functional "
"overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not structured as a "
"tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti Consulting CC. we"
" frequently run training courses and have realised that a third resource "
"is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through learning the "
"key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted us to "
"produce this work."

"This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to "
"run a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is "
"structured with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users "
"alike and has many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout "
"the text."
