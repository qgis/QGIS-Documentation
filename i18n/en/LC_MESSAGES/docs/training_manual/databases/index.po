"In this module you will learn about how to use Spatial Databases with "
"QGIS to manage, display and manipulate data in the database as well as "
"performing analysis by querying. We will primarily use PostgreSQL and "
"PostGIS (which were covered in previous sections), but the same concepts "
"are applicable to other spatial database implementations including "
"spatialite."
