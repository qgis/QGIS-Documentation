"Spatial Databases allow the storage of the geometries of records inside a"
" Database as well as providing functionality for querying and retrieving "
"the records  using these Geometries. In this module we will use PostGIS, "
"an extension to PostgreSQL, to learn how to setup a spatial database, "
"import data from shapefiles into the database and make use of the "
"geographic functions that PostGIS offers."
