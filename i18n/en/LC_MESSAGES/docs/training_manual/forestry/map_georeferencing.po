"A common forestry task would be the update of the information for a "
"forestry area. It is possible that the previous information for that area"
" dates several years back and was collected analogically (that is, in "
"paper) or perhaps it was digitized but all you have left is the paper "
"version of that inventory data."

"Most likely you would like to use that information in your GIS to, for "
"example, compare later with later inventories. This means that you will "
"need to digitize the information at hand using your GIS software. But "
"before you can start the digitizing, there is an important first step to "
"be done, scanning and georeferencing your paper map."

"The first task you will have to do is to scan your map. If your map is "

"If you are going to use a different map that the one provided with this "
