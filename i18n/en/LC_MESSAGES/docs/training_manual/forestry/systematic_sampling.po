"There are several methods to inventory forests, each of them suiting "
"different purposes and conditions. For example, one very accurate way to "
"inventory a forest (if you consider only tree species) would be to visit the"
" forest and make a list of every tree and their characteristics. As you can "
"imagine this is not commonly applicable except for some small areas or some "
"special situations."

"The most common way to find out about a forest is by sampling it, that is, "
"taking measurements in different locations at the forest and generalizing "
"that information to the whole forest. These measurements are often made in "
"*sample plots* that are smaller forest areas that can be easily measured. "
"The sample plots can be of any size (for ex. 50 m2, 0.5 ha) and form (for "
"ex. circular, rectangular, variable size), and can be located in the forest "
"in different ways (for ex. randomly, systematically, along lines). The size,"
" form and location of the sample plots are usually decided following "
"statistical, economical and practical considerations. If you have no "
"forestry knowledge, you might be interested in reading `this Wikipedia "
"article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_inventory>`_."
