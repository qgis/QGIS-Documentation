"As we have already mentioned, the processing framework can run algorithms"
" from other applications, but it also contains native algorithms that "
"need no external software to be run. To start exploring the processing "
"framework, we are going to run one of those native algorithms. In "
"particular, we are going to calculate the centroids of set of polygons."

"First, open the QGIS project corresponding to this lesson. It contains "

"Now go to the text box at the top of the toolbox. That is the search box,"
" and if you type text in it, it will filter the list of algorithms so "
"just those ones containing the entered text are shown. If there are "
"algorithms that match your search but belong to a provider that is not "
"active, an additional label will be shown in the lower part of the "
"toolbox."

"The search box is a very practical way of finding the algorithm you are "
"looking for. At the bottom of the dialog, an additional label shows that "
"there are algorithms that match your search but belong to a provider that"
" is not active. If you click on the link in that label, the list of "
"algorithms will also include results from those inactive providers, which"
" will be shown in light gray. A link to activate each inactive provider "
"is also shown. We'll see later how to activate other providers."

"To execute an algorithm, you just have to double-click on its name in the"

"All algorithms have a similar interface, which basically contains input "
"parameters that you have to fill, and outputs that you have to select "
"where to store. In this case, the only input we have is a vector layer "
"with polygons."

"Select the *Polygons* layer as input. The algorithm has a single output, "
"which is the centroids layer. There are two options to define where a "
"data output is saved: enter a filepath or save it to a temporary filename"

msgid ""
"In case you want to set a destination and not save the result in a "
"temporary file, the format of the output is defined by the filename "
"extension. To select a format, just select the corresponding file "
"extension (or add it if you are directly typing the filepath instead). If"
" the extension of the filepath you entered does not match any of the "
"supported ones, a default extension (usually :file:`.dbf` for tables, "
":file:`.tif` for raster layers and :file:`.shp` for vector ones) will be "
"appended to the filepath and the file format corresponding to that "
"extension will be used to save the layer or table."

"Temporary files are deleted once you close QGIS. If you create a project "

"The output has the same CRS as the input. Geoalgorithms assumes all input"
" layers share the same CRS and do not perform any reprojection. Except in"
" the case of some special algorithms (for instance, reprojection ones), "
"the outputs will also have that same CRS. We will see more about this "
"soon."

"Try yourself saving it using different file formats (use, for instance, "
":file:`shp` and :file:`geojson` as extensions). Also, if you do not want "
"the layer to be loaded in QGIS after it is generated, you can check off "
"the checkbox that is found below the output path box."
