"We already know the graphical modeler, which is one way of automating "
"processing tasks. However, in some situations, the modeler might not be what"
" we need to automate a given task. Let's see one of those situation and how "
"to easily solve it using a different functionality: the iterative execution "
"of algorithms."

"You will recognize our well-known DEM from previous chapters and a set of "
"watersheds extracted from it. Imagine that you need to cut the DEM into "
"several smaller layers, each of them containing just the elevation data "
"corresponding to a single watershed. That will be useful if you later want "
"to calculate some parameters related to each watershed, such as its mean "
"elevation or it hypsographic curve."

"This can be a lengthy and tedious task, especially if the number of "

"Doing this for all the watersheds will produce the result we are looking "

"First of all, remove the previous selection, so all polygons will be used "
"again. Now open the *Clip grid with polygon* algorithm and select the same "

"watersheds layer."

"This button will cause the selected input layer to be split into as many "
"layer as feature are found in it, each of them containing a single polygon. "
"With that, the algorithm will be called repeatedly, one for each one of "
"those single-polygon layers. The result, instead of just one raster layer in"
" the case of this algorithm, will be a set of raster layers, each one of "
"them corresponding to one of the executions of the algorithm."

"For each layer, the black and white color palette, (or whatever palette you "

" That's the reason why you can see the different pieces and the colors do "
