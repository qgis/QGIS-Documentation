"Unlike other analysis plugins in QGIS, you will not find in processing "
"geoalgorithms any \"Use only selected features\" checkbox or similar. The "
"behaviour regarding selection is set for the whole plugin and all its "
"algorithms, and not for each algorithm execution. Algorithms follow the "
"following simple rules when using a vector layer."

"You can test that yourself by selecting a few points in any of the layers "
"that we used in the last chapter, and running the reprojection algorithm on "
"them. The reprojected layer that you will obtain will contain only those "
"points that were selected, unless there was no selection, which will cause "
"the resulting layer to contain all points from the origin layer."

"To make a selection, you can use any of the available methods and tools in "
"QGIS. However, you can also use a geoalgorithm to do so. Algorithms for "
"creating a selection are found in the toolbox under *Vector/Selection*"

"You will notice that this algorithm does not produce any output, but "
"modifies the input layer (not the layer itself, but its selection). This is "
"an uncommon behaviour, since all the other algorithms will produce new "
"layers and not alter the input layers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the selction is not part of the data itself, but something that only "
"exist within GIS, these selection algorithms only must be used selecting a "
"layer that is open in QGIS, and not with the file selection option that you "
"can find in the corresponding parameter value box."

"The selection we have just made, like most of the ones created by the rest "
"of the  selection algorithms, can also be done manually from QGIS, so you "
"might be wondering what is the point on using an algorithm for that. "
"Although now this might not make much sense to you, we will later see how to"
" create models and scripts. If you want to make a selection in the middle of"
" a model (which defines a processing workflow), only a geoalgorithm "
"algorithms can be added to a model, and other QGIS elements and operations "
"cannot be added. That is the reason why some processing algorithms duplicate"
" functionality that is also available in other QGIS elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/selection.rst:38

"By now, just remember that selections can be made using processing "
"geoalgorithms, and that algorithms will only use the selected features if a "
"selection exists, or all features otherwise."
