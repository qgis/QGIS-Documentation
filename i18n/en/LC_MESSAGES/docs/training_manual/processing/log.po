"All the analysis performed with the processing framework is logged in "
"QGIS logging system. This allows you to know more about what has been "
"done with the processing tools, to solve problems when they happen, and "
"also to re--run previous operations, since the logging system also "
"implements some interactivity."

"To open the log, click on the balloon at the bottom right, on the QGIS "
"status bar. Some algorithms might leave here information about their "
"execution. For instance, those algorithms that call an external "
"application usually log the console output of that application to this "
"entry. If you have a look at it, you will see that the output of the SAGA"
" algorithm that we just run (and that fail to execute because input data "
"was not correct) is stored here."

"This is helpful to understand what is going on. Advanced users will be "
"able to analyze that output to find out why the algorithm failed. If you "
"are not an advanced user, this will be useful for others to help you "
"diagnose the problem you are having, which might be a problem in the "
"installation of the external software or an issue with the data you "
"provided."

"Even if the algorithm could be executed, some algorithms might leave "
"warnings in case the result might not be right. For instance, when "
"executing an interpolation algorithm with a very small amount of points, "
"the algorithm can run and will produce a result, but it is likely that it"
" will not be correct, since more points should be used. It's a good idea "
"to regularly check for this type of warnings if you are not sure about "
"some aspect of a given algorithm."

"From the *Processing* menu, under the *History* section, you'll find "
"*Algorithms*. All algorithms that are executed, even if they are executed"
" from the GUI and not from the console (which will be explained later in "
"this manual) are stored in this section as a console call. That means "
"that everytime you run an algorithm, a console command is added to the "
"log, and you have the full history of your working session. Here is how "
"that history looks like:"

"This can be very useful when starting working with the console, to learn "
"about the syntax of algorithms. We will use it when we discuss how to run"
" analysis commands from the console."

"The history is also interactive, and you can re--run any previous "
"algorithm just by double--clicking on its entry. This is an easy way of "
"replicating the work we already did before."

"For instance, try the following. Open the data corresponding to the first"
" chapter of this manual and run the algorithm explained there. Now go to "
"the log dialog and locate the last algorithm in the list, which "
"corresponds to the algorithm you have just run. Double--click on it an a "
"new result should be produced, just like when you run it using the normal"
" dialog and calling it from the toolbox."

"You can also modify the algorithm. Just copy it, open the "
":menuselection:`Plugins --> Python console`, click on "
":menuselection:`Import class --> Import Processing class`, then paste it "
"to re-run the analysis; change the text at will. To display the resulting"
" file, type :kbd:`iface.addVectorLayer('/path/filename.shp', 'Layer name "
