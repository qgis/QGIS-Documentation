"For this lesson, we are going to calculate a slope layer for an area "
"surrounding a city area, which is given in a vector layer with a single "
"polygon. The base DEM is divided in two raster layers that, together, "
"cover an area much larger than that around the city that we want to work "
"with. If you open the project corresponding to this lesson, you will see "
"something like this."

"First, we create a rectangle defining the area that we want. To do it, we"
" create a layer containing the bounding box of the layer with the limits "
"of the city area, and then we buffer it, so as to have a raster layer "
"that covers a bit more that the strictly necessary."

"It is a rounded box, but we can easily get the equivalent box with square"

"You can save time merging first and then cropping, and you will avoid "
"calling the clipping algorithm twice. However, if there are several "
"layers to merge and they have a rather big size, you will end up with a "
"large layer than it can later be difficult to process. In that case, you "
"might have to call the clipping algorithm several times, which might be "
"time consuming, but don't worry, we will soon see that there are some "
"additional tools to automate that operation. In this example, we just "
"have two layers, so you shouldn't worry about that now."

msgid ""
"A slope layer can be computed with the *Slope, Aspect, Curvature* "
"algorithm, but the DEM obtained in the last step is not suitable as "
"input, since elevation values are in meters but cellsize is not expressed"
" in meters (the layer uses a CRS with geographic coordinates). A "
"reprojection is needed. To reproject a raster layer, the *Warp "
"(reproject)* algorithm can be used again. We reproject into a CRS with "
"meters as units (e.g. 3857), so we can then correctly calculate the "
"slope, with either SAGA or GDAL."

"The slope produced by the *Slope, Aspect, Curvature* algorithm can be "
