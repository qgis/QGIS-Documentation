"surrounding a city area, which is given in a vector layer with a single "
"polygon. The base DEM is divided in two raster layers that, together, cover "
"an area much larger than that around the city that we want to work with. If "

"Note: You can save time merging first and then cropping, and you will avoid "

"than it can later be difficult to process. In that case, you might have to "
"call the clipping algorithm several times, which might be time consuming, "

"A slope layer can be computed with the *Slope, Aspect, Curvature* algorithm,"
