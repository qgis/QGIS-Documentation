"In this lesson we will perform some hydrological analysis. This analysis "
"will be used in some of the following lessons, as it constitutes a very "
"good example of an analysis workflow, and we will use it to demonstrate "
"some advanced features."

"In this lesson, we are going to do some hydrological analysis. Starting "
"with a DEM, we are going to extract a channel network, delineate "
"watersheds and calculate some statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:13
msgid ""
"The first thing is to load the project with the lesson data, which just "
"contains a DEM."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first module to execute is *Catchment area* (in some SAGA versions it"
" is called *Flow accumulation (Top Down)*). You can use anyone of  the "
"others named *Catchment area*. They have different algorithms underneath,"
" but the results are basically the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:19

"Select the DEM in the *Elevation* field, and leave the default values for"
" the rest of parameters."

"Some algorithms calculate many layers, but the *Catchment Area* one is "
"the only one we will be using."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:25
msgid "You can get rid of the other ones if you want."

msgid "The rendering of the layer is not very informative."

msgid ""
"To know why, you can have a look at the histogram and you will see that "
"values are not evenly distributed (there are a few cells with very high "
"value, those corresponding to the channel network). Calculating the "
"logarithm of the catchment area value yields a layer that conveys much "
"more information (you can do it using the raster calculator)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:35
msgid ""
"The catchment area (also known as flow accumulation), can be used to set "
"a threshold for channel initiation. This can be done using the *Channel "
"network* algorithm. Here is how you have to set it up (note the "
"*Initiation threshold* *Greater than* 10.000.000)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:40
msgid ""
"Use the original catchment area layer, not the logarithm one. That one "
"was just for rendering purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:42
msgid ""
"If you increase the *Initiation threshold* value, you will get a more "
"sparse channel network. If you decrease it, you will get a denser one. "
"With the proposed value, this is what you get."
msgstr ""

"The image above shows just the resulting vector layer and the DEM, but "
"there should be also a raster one with the same channel network. That "
"raster one will be, in fact, the one we will be using."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:49
msgid ""
"Now, we will use the *Watersheds basins* algorithm to delineate the "
"subbasins corresponding to that channel network, using as outlet points "
"all the junctions in it. Here is how you have to set the corresponding "
"parameters dialog."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:54
msgid "And this is what you will get."

"This is a raster result. You can vectorise it using the *Vectorising grid"
" classes* algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:65
msgid ""
"Now, let's try to compute statistics about the elevation values in one of"
" the subbasins. The idea is to have a layer that just represents the "
"elevation within that subbasin and then pass it to the module that "
"calculates those statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:67
msgid ""
"First, let's clip the original DEM with the polygon representing a "
"subbasin. We will use the *Clip raster with polygon* algorithm. If we "
"select a single subbasin polygon and then call the clipping algorithm, we"
" can clip the DEM to the area covered by that polygon, since the "
"algorithm is aware of the selection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:69
msgid "Select a polygon,"

"The element selected in the input field is, or course, the DEM we want to"

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:79

"We will use both the basin calculations procedure and the statistics "
"calculation in other lessons, to find out how other elements can help us "
"automate both of them and work more effectively."
