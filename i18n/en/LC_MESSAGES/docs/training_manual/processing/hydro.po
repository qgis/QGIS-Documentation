"In this lesson we will perform some hydrological analysis. This analysis "
"will be used in some of the following lessons, as it constitutes a very good"
" example of an analysis workflow, and we will use it to demonstrate some "
"advanced features."

"In this lesson, we are going to do some hydrological analysis. Starting with"
" a DEM, we are going to extract a channel network, delineate watersheds and "
"calculate some statistics."

"The first thing is to load the project with the lesson data, which just "
"contains a DEM."

"The first module to execute is *Catchment area*. You can use anyone of  the "
"others named *Catchment area*. They have different algorithms underneath, "
"but the results are basically the same."

"Select the DEM in the *Elevation* field, and leave the default values for "
"the rest of parameters."

"Some algorithms calculate many layers, but the *Catchment Area* one is the "
"only one we will be using."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rendering of the layer is not very informative."

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:34
msgid ""
"To know why, you can have a look at the histogram and you will see that "
"values are not evenly distributed (there are a few cells with very high "
"value, those corresponding to the channel network). Calculating the "
"logarithm of the catchment area value yields a layer that conveys much more "
"information (you can do it using the raster calculator)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:38
msgid ""
"The catchment area (also known as flow accumulation), can be used to set a "
"threshold for channel initiation. This can be done using the *Channel "
"network* algorithm. Here is how you have to set it up (note the *Initiation "
"threshold* *Greater than* 10.000.000)."

"Use the original catchment area layer, not the logarithm one. That one was "
"just for rendering purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:45
msgid ""
"If you increase the *Initiation threshold* value, you will get a more sparse"
" channel network. If you decrease it, you will get a denser one. With the "
"proposed value, this is what you get."

"The image above shows just the resulting vector layer and the DEM, but there"
" should be also a raster one with the same channel network. That raster one "
"will be, in fact, the one we will be using."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:52
msgid ""
"Now, we will use the *Watersheds basins* algorithm to delineate the "
"subbasins corresponding to that channel network, using as outlet points all "
"the junctions in it. Here is how you have to set the corresponding "
"parameters dialog."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:57
msgid "And this is what you will get."

"This is a raster result. You can vectorise it using the *Vectorising grid "
"classes* algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:68
msgid ""
"Now, let's try to compute statistics about the elevation values in one of "
"the subbasins. The idea is to have a layer that just represents the "
"elevation within that subbasin and then pass it to the module that "
"calculates those statistics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hydro.rst:70
msgid ""
"First, let's clip the original DEM with the polygon representing a subbasin."
" We will use the *Clip grid with polygon* algorithm. If we select a single "
"subbasin polygon and then call the clipping algorithm, we can clip the DEM "
"to the area covered by that polygon, since the algorithm is aware of the "
"selection."

"We will use both the basin calculations procedure and the statistics "
"calculation in other lessons, to find out how other elements can help us "
"automate both of them and work more effectively."
