"Just like the manual of a word processor doesn't teach you how to write a "
"novel or a poem, or a CAD tutorial doesn't show you how to calculate the "
"size of a beam for a building, this guide will not teach you spatial "
"analysis. Instead, it will show you how to use the QGIS processing "
"framework, a powerful tool for performing spatial analysis, but it is up to "
"you to learn the required concepts that are needed to understand that type "
"of analysis. Without them, there is no point on using the framework and its "
"algorithms, although you might be tempted to try."

"Given a set of points and a value of a given variable value at each point, "
"you can calculate a raster layer from them using the *Kriging* geoalgorithm."
" The parameters dialog for that module is like the following one."

"By reading this manual, you will learn things such as how to use that "
"module, how to run it in a batch process to create raster layers from "
"hundreds of points layers in a single run, or what happens if the input "
"layer has some points selected. However, the parameters themselves are not "
"explained. A seasoned analyst with a good knowledge of geostatistics will "
"have no problem understanding those parameters. If you are not one of them "
"and *sill*, *range*, or *nugget* are not familiar concepts to you, then you "
"should not use the *Kriging* module. More than that, you are far from being "
"ready to use the *Kriging* module, since it requires learning about concepts"
" such as spatial autocorrelation or semivariograms, which probably you also "
"haven't heard before, or at least haven't studied long enough. You should "
"first study and understand them, and then come back to QGIS to actually run "
"it and perform the analysis. Ignoring this will result in wrong results and "
"poor (and most likely useless) analysis."

"Although not all algorithms are as complex as kriging (but some of them are "
"even more complex!), almost all of them require understanding the "
"fundamental analysis ideas that they are based on. Without that knowledge, "
"using them will most likely lead to poor results."

"Using geoalgorithms without having a good foundation of spatial analysis is "
"like trying to write a novel without knowing anything about grammar or "
"syntax, and having no knowledge about storytelling. You might get a result, "
"but it is likely to have no value at all.  Please, don't fool yourself and "
"think that after reading this guide you are already capable of performing "
"spatial analysis and get sound results. You need to study spatial analysis "
"as well."
