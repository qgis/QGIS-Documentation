"We have already created a few models, and in this lesson we are going to "
"see how we can combine them on a single bigger one. A model behaves like "
"any other algorithm, which means that you can add a model that you have "
"already created as part of another one that you create after that."

"In this case, we are going to expand our hydrological model, by adding "
"the mean TWI value in each of the basins that it generates as result. To "
"do that, we need to calculate the TWI, and to compute the statistics. "
"Since we have already created a model to calculate TWI from a DEM, it is "
"a good idea to reuse that model instead of adding the algorithms it "
"contains individually."

"First, we will add the TWI model. For it to be available, it should have "

"Add it to the current model and use the input DEM as its input. The "
