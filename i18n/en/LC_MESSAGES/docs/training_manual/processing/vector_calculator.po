"We already know how to use the raster calculator to create new raster "
"layers using mathematical expressions. A similar algorithm is available "
"for vector layers, and generates a new layer with the same attributes of "
"the input layer, plus an additional one with the result of the expression"
" entered. The algorithm is called *Field calculator* and has the "
"following parameters dialog."

"First, let's calculate the population density of white people in each "
"polygon, which represents a census. We have two fields in the attributes "
"table that we can use for that, namely ``WHITE`` and ``SHAPE_AREA``. We "
"just have to divide them and multiply by one million (to have density per"
" square km), so we can use the following formula in the corresponding "
"field"
