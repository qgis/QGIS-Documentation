"In this lesson we will use the graphical modeler, a powerful component "

"A normal session with the processing tools includes more than running a "
"single algorithm. Usually several of them are run to obtain a result, and"
" the outputs of some of those algorithms are used as input for some of "
"the other ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_twi.rst:12
msgid ""
"Using the graphical modeler, that workflow can be put into a model, which"
" will run all the necessary algorithms in a single run, thus simplifying "
"the whole process and automating it."

"To start this lesson, we are going to calculate a parameter named "
"Topographic Wetness Index. The algorithm that computes it is called "
"*Topographic wetness index (twi)*"

"As you can see, there are two mandatory inputs: *Slope* and *Catchment "
"area*. There is also an optional input, but we will not be using it, so "
"we can ignore it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The data for this lesson contains just a DEM, so we do not have any of "
"the required inputs. However, we know how to calculate both of them from "
"that DEM, since we have already seen the algorithms to compute slope and "
"catchment area. So we can first compute those layers and then use them "
"for the TWI algorithm."

"Here are the parameter dialogs that you should use to calculate the 2 "

"This is the result that you will obtain (the default singleband "

"the ``twi.qml`` style provided."

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_twi.rst:38
msgid ""
"What we will try to do now is to create an algorithm that calculates the "
"TWI from a DEM in just one single step. That will save us work in case we"
" later have to compute a TWI layer from another DEM, since we will need "
"just one single step to do it instead of the 3 ones above. All the "
"processes that we need are found in the  toolbox, so what we have to do "
"is to define the workflow to wrap them. This is where the graphical "
"modeler comes in."

"Two things are needed to create a model: setting the inputs that it will "
"need, and defining the algorithm that it contains. Both of them are done "
"by adding elements from the two tabs in the left--hand side of the "
"modeler window: *Inputs* and *Algorithms*"
msgstr ""

"Let's start with the inputs. In this case we do not have much to add. We "

"Double click on the *Raster layer* input and you will see the following "

msgid ""
"Here we will have to define the input we want. Since we expect this "
"raster layer to be a DEM, we will call it *DEM*. That's the name that the"
" user of the model will see when running it. Since we need that layer to "
"work, we will define it as a mandatory layer."

"Now let's move to the *Algorithms* tab. The first algorithm we have to "

msgstr ""

"This dialog is very similar to the one that you can find when running the"
" algorithm from the toolbox, but the element that you can use as "
"parameter values are not taken from the current QGIS project, but from "
"the model itself. That means that, in this case, we will not have all the"
" raster layers of our project available for the *Elevation* field, but "
"just the ones defined in our model. Since we have added just one single "
"raster input named *DEM*, that will be the only raster layer that we will"
" see in the list corresponding to the *Elevation* parameter."

"Output generated by an algorithm are handled a bit differently when the "
"algorithm is used as a part of a model. Instead of selecting the filepath"
" where you want to save each output, you just have to specify if that "
"ouput is an intermediate layer (and you do not want it to be preserved "
"after the model has been executed), or it is a final one. In this case, "
"all layers produced by this algorithm are intermediate. We will only use "
"one of them (the slope layer), but we do not want to keep it, since we "
"just need it to calculate the TWI layer, which is the final result that "
"we want to obtain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When layers are not a final result, you should just leave the "

"There is not much to select in this first dialog, since we do not have "

"modeler canvas."

"The second algorithm we have to add to our model is the catchment area "
"algorithm. We will use the algorithm named *Catchment area (Paralell)*. "
"We will use the DEM layer again as input, and none of the ouputs it "
"produces are final, so here is how you have to fill the corresponding "

"In this case, we will not be using the DEM as input, but instead, we will"
" use the slope and catchment area layers that are calculated by the "
"algorithms that we previously added. As you add new algorithms, the "
