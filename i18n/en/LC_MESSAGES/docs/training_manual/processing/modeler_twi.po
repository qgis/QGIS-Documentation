"A normal session with the processign tools includes more than running a "

"As you can see, there are two mandatory inputs: *Slope* and *Catchment "

"The data for this lesson contains just a DEM, so we do not have any of the "
"required inputs. However, we know how to calculate both of them from that "
"DEM, since we have already seen the algorithms to compute slope and "
"catchment area. So we can first compute those layers and then use them for "
"the TWI algorithm."

"What we will try to do now is to create an algorithm that calculates the TWI"
" from a DEM in jut one single step. That will save us work in case we later "
"have to compute a TWI layer from another DEM, since we will need just one "
"single step to do it instead of the 3 ones above. All the processes that we "
"need are found in the  toolbox, so what we have to do is to define the "
"workflow to wrap them. This is where the graphical modeler comes in."

"This dialog is very similar to the one that you can find when running the "

"values are not taken from the current QGIS project, but from the model "
"itself. That means that, in this case, we will not have all the raster "
"layers of our project available for the *Elevation* field, but just the ones"
" defined in our model. Since we have added just one single raster input "

"Output generated by an algorithm are handled a bit differently when the "

"is an intermediate layer (and you do not want it to be preserved after the "
"model has been executed), or it is a final one. In this case, all layers "
"produced by this algorithm are intermediate. We will only use one of them "
