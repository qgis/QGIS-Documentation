"This guide is comprised of a set of small exercises of progressive "
"complexity. If you have never used the processing framework, you should "
"start from the very beginning. If you have some previous experience, feel "
"free to skip lessons. They are more or less independent from each other, and"
" each one introduces some new concept or some new element, which is "
"indicated in the chapter title and the short introduction at the begining of"
" each chapter. That should make it easy to locate lessons dealing with a "
"particular topic."
