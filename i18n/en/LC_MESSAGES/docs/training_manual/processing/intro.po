" that it relies on. It assumes basic knowledge of QGIS. The chapters "
"about scripting assume you have some basic knowledge of Python and maybe "
"the QGIS Python API."

"This guide is comprised of a set of small exercises of progressive "
"complexity. If you have never used the processing framework, you should "
"start from the very beginning. If you have some previous experience, feel"
" free to skip lessons. They are more or less independent from each other,"
" and each one introduces some new concept or some new element, which is "
"indicated in the chapter title and the short introduction at the begining"
" of each chapter. That should make it easy to locate lessons dealing with"
" a particular topic."
