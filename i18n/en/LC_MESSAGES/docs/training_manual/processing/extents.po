"In this lesson we will see how to define extents, which are needed by "
"some algorithms, especially raster ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:10
msgid ""
"Some algorithms require an extent to define the area to be covered by the"
" analysis they perform, and usually to define the extent of the resulting"
" layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:12
msgid ""
"When an extent is required, it can be defined manually by entering the "
"four values that define it (min X, min Y, max X, max Y), but there are "
"other more practical and more interesting ways of doing it as well. We "
"will see all of them in this lesson."

"First, let's open an algorithm that requires an extent to be defined. "
"Open the *Rasterize* algorithm, which creates a raster layer from a "
"vector layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:18
msgid ""
"All the parameters, except for the last two ones, are used to define "
"which layer is to be rasterized, and configure how the rasterization "
"process should work. The two last parameters, on the other hand, define "
"the characteristics of the output layer. That means that they define the "
"area that is covered (which is not necessarily the same area covered by "
"the input vector layer), and the resolution/cellsize (which cannot be "
"infered from the vector layer, since vector layers do not have a "
"cellsize)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:20
msgid ""
"The first thing you can do is to type the 4 defining values explained "
"before, separated by commas."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:24
msgid ""
"That doesn't need any extra explanation. While this is the most flexible "
"option, it is also the less practical in some cases, and that's why other"
" options are implemented. To access them, you have to click on the button"
" on the right--hand side of the extent text box."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:28
msgid "Let's see what each one of them does."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:30
msgid ""
"The first option is *Use layer/canvas extent*, which will show the "
"selection dialog shown below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:34
msgid ""
"Here you can select the extent of the canvas (the extent covered by the "
"current zoom), or the extension any of the available layers. Select it "
"and click on *OK*, and the text box will be automatically filled with the"
" corresponding values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:36
msgid ""
"The second option is *Select extent on canvas*. In this case, the "
"algorithm dialog disappears and you can click and drag on the QGIS canvas"
" to define the desired extent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:40
msgid ""
"Once you release the mouse button, the dialog will reappear and the text "
"box will already have the values corresponding to the defined extent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:42
msgid ""
"The last option is *Use min covering extent from input layers*, which is "
"the default option. This will compute the min covering extent of all "
"layers used to run the algorithm, and there is no need to enter any value"
" in the text box. In the case of a single input layer, as in the "
"algorithm we are running, the same extent can be obtained by selecting "
"that same input layer in the *Use layer/canvas extent* that we already "
"saw. However, when there are several input layers, the min covering "
"extent does not correspond to any of the input layer extent, since it is "
"computed from all of them together."

msgid "We will use this last method to execute our rasterization algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:46
msgid "Fill the parameters dialog as shown next, and press *OK*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:50
msgid ""
"In this case, better use an *Integer (1 byte)* instead of a *Floating "
"point (4 byte)*, since the *NAME* is an integer with maximum value=64. "
"This will result in a smaller file size and faster computations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:52
msgid ""
"You will get a rasterized layer that covers exactly the area covered by "
"the original vector layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:56
msgid ""
"In some cases, the last option, *Use min covering extent from input "
"layers*, might not be available. This will happen in those algorithm that"
" do not have input layers, but just parameters of other types. In that "
"case, you will have to enter the value manually or use any of the other "
"options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:58
msgid ""
"Notice that, when a selection exist, the extent of the layer is that of "
"the whole set of features, and the selection is not used to compute the "
"extent, even though the rasterization is executed on the selected items "
"only. In that case, you might want to actually create a new layer from "
"the selection, and then use it as input."
