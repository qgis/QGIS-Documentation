"In this lesson we will see how to define extents, which are needed by some "
"algorithms, specially raster ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:12
msgid ""
"Some algorithms require an extent to define the area to be covered by the "
"analysis they perform, and usually to define the extent of the resulting "
"layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:14
msgid ""
"When an extent is required, it can be defined manually but entering the four"
" values that define it (min X, min Y, max X, max Y), but there are other "
"more practical and more interesting ways of doing it as well. We will see "
"all of them in this lesson."

"First, let's open an algorithm that requires an extent to be defined. Open "
"the *Shapes to grid* algorithm, which creates a raster layer from a vector "
"layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:20
msgid ""
"All the parameters, except for the last two ones, are used to define which "
"layer is to be rasterized, and configure how the rasterization process "
"should work. The two last parameters, on the other hand, define the "
"characteristics of the output layer. That means that they define the area "
"that is covered (which is not necesarily the same area covered by the input "
"vector layer), and the resolution/cellsize (which cannot be infered from the"
" vector layer, since vector layers do not have a cellsize)."

"The first thing you can do is to type the 4 defining values explained "
"before, separated by commas."

"That doesn't need any extra explanation. While this is the most flexible "
"option, it is also the less practical in some cases, and that's why other "
"options are implemented. To access them, you have to click on the button on "
"the right--hand side of the extent text box."

"The first option is *Use layer/canvas extent*, which will show the selection"
" dialog shown below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:36
msgid ""
"Here you can select the extent of the canvas (the extent covered by the "
"current zoom), or the extension any of the available layers. Select it and "
"click on *OK*, and the text box will be automatically filled with the "
"corresponding values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:38
msgid ""
"The second option is *Select extent on canvas*. In this case, the algorithm "
"dialog disappears and you can click and drag on the QGIS canvas to define "
"the desired extent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:42
msgid ""
"Once you release the mouse button, the dialog will reappear and the text box"
" will already have the values corresponding to the defined extent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:44
msgid ""
"The last option is *Use min covering extent from input layers*, which is the"
" default option. This will compute the min covering extent of all layers "
"used to run the algorithm, and there is no need to enter any value in the "
"text box. In the case of a single input layer, as in the algorithm we are "
"running, the same extent can be obtained by selecting that same input layer "
"in the *Use layer/canvas extent* that we already saw. However, when there "
"are several input layers, the min covering extent does not correspond to any"
" of the input layer extent, since it is computed from all of them together."

"You will get a rasterized layer that covers exactly the area covered by the "
"original vector layer."

msgid ""
"In some cases, the last option, *Use min covering extent from input layers*,"
" might not be avaialble. This will happen in those algorithm that do not "
"have input layers, but just parameters of other types. In that case, you "
"will have to enter the value manually or use any of the other options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/extents.rst:58
msgid ""
"Notice that, when a selection exist, the extent of the layer is that of the "
"whole set of features, and the selection is not used to compute the extent. "
"In that case, you might want to actually create a new layer from the "
"selection, and then use it as input."
