"Interpolation is a common technique, and it can be used to demonstrate "
"several techniques that can be applied using the QGIS processing "
"framework. This lesson uses some interpolation algorithms that were "
"already introduced, but has a different approach."

"The data for this lesson contains also a points layer, in this case with "
"elevation data. We are going to interpolate it much in the same way as we"
" did in the previous lesson, but this time we will save part of the "
"original data to use it for assessing the quality of the interpolation "
"process."

"First, we have to rasterize the points layer and fill the resulting no--"
"data cells, but using just a fraction of the points in the layer. We will"
" save 10% of the points for a later check, so we need to have 90% of the "
"points ready for the interpolation. To do so, we could use the *Split "
"shapes layer randomly* algorithm, which we have already used in a "
"previous lesson, but there is a better way to do that, without having to "
"create any new intermediate layer. Instead of that, we can just select "
"the points we want to use for the interpolation (the 90% fraction), and "
"then run the algorithm. As we have already seen, the rasterizing "
"algorithm will use only those selected points and ignore the rest. The "
"selection can be done using the *Random selection* algorithm. Run it with"
" the following parameters."

"To check the quality of the interpolation, we can now use the points that"
" are not selected. At this point, we know the real elevation (the value "
"in the points layer) and the interpolated elevation (the value in the "
"interpolated raster layer). We can compare the two by computing the "
"differences between those values."

"The raster layer to select (the algorithm supports multiple raster, but "

"If your field with the values from the raster layer has a different name,"
" you should modify the above formula accordingly. Running this algorithm,"
