"This chapter shows another practical case where interpolation algorithms are"
" used."

"Interpolation is a common technique, and it can be used to demonstrate "
"several techniques that can be applied using the QGIS processing framework. "
"This lesson uses some interpolation algorithms that were already introduced,"
" but has a different approach."

"The data for this lesson contains also a points layer, in this case with "
"elevation data. We are going to interpolate it much in the same way as we "
"did in the previous lesson, but this time we will save part of the original "
"data to use it for assessing the quality of the interpolation process."

"First, we have to rasterize the points layer and fill the resulting no--data"
" cells, but using just a fraction of the points in the layer. We will save "
"10% of the points for a later check, so we need to have 90% of the points "
"ready for the interpolation. To do so, we could use the *Split shapes layer "
"randomly* algorithm, which we have already used in a previous lesson, but "
"there is a better way to do that, without having to create any new "
"intermediate layer. Instead of that, we can just select the points we want "
"to use for the interpolation (the 90% fraction), and then run the algorithm."
" As we have already seen, the rasterizing algorithm will use only those "
"selected points and ignore the rest. The selection can be done using the "
"*Random selection* algorithm. Run it with the following parameters."

"Now run the *Shapes to grid* algorithm to get the first raster layer, and "
"then run the *Close gaps* algorithm to fill the no--data cells [Cell "

"To check the quality of the interpolation, we can now use the points that "
"are not selected. At this point, we know the real elevation (the value in "
"the points layer) and the interpolated elevation (the value in the "
"interpolated raster layer). We can compare the two by computing the "
"differences between those values."

"The points contain the original values, but not the interpolated ones. To "

"The raster layer to select (the algorithm supports multiple raster, but we "
"just need one) is the resulting one from the interpolation. We have renamed "
"it to *interpolate* and that layer name is the one that will be used for the"
" name of the field to add."

"Now we have a vector layer that contains both values, with points that were "

"If your field with the values from the raster layer has a different name, "
"you should modify the above formula accordingly. Running this algorithm, you"
" will get a new layer with just the points that we haven't used for the "
"interpolation, each of them containing the difference between the two "
"elevation values."
