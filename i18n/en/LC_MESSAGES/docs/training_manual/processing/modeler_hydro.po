"The first model that we created in the previous chapter was a very simple"
" one, with just one input and 3 algorithms. More complex models can be "
"created, with different types of inputs and containing more step. For "
"this chapter we will work with a model that creates a vector layer with "
"watersheds, based on a DEM and a threshold value. That will be very "
"useful for calculating several vector layers corresponding to different "
"thresholds, without having to repeat each single step each time."

"This lesson does not contain instructions about how to create you model. "
"You already know the necessary steps (we saw them in a previous lesson) "
"and you have already seen the basic ideas about the modeler, so you "
"should try it yourself. Spend a few minutes trying to create your model, "
"and don't worry about making mistakes. Remember: first add the inputs and"
" then add the algorithms that use them to create the workflow."

"In case you could not create the full model yourself and you need some "
"extra help, the data folder corresponding to this lesson contains an "
"'almost' finished version of it. Open the modeler and then open the model"
" file that you will find in the data folder. You should see something "
"like this."

"This model contains all the steps needed to complete the calculation, but"
" it just has one input: the DEM. That means that the threshold for "
"channel definition use a fixed value, which makes the model not as useful"
" as it could be. That is not a problem, since we can edit the model, and "
"that is exactly what we will do."

"First, let's add a numerical input. That will ask the user for a "
"numerical input that we can use when such a value is needed in any of the"
" algorithms included in our model. Click on the *Number* entry in the "
"inputs tree, and you will see the corresponding dialog. Fill it with the "

"The input that we have just added is not used, so the model hasn't "
"actually changed. We have to link that input to the algorithm that uses "
"it, in this case the *Channel network* one. To edit an algorithm that "
"already exists in the modeler, just click on the pen icon on the "
"corresponding box in the canvas. If you click on the *Channel network* "
"algorithm, you will see something like this."

"The dialog is filled with the current values used by the algorithm. You "
"can see that the threshold parameter has a fixed value of 1,000,000 (this"
" is also the default value of the algorithm, but any other value could be"
" put in there). However, you might notice that the parameter is not "
"entered in a common text box, but in an option menu. If you unfold it, "
"you will see something like this."

"The input that we added is there and we can select it. Whenever an "
"algorithm in a model requires a numerical value, you can hardcode it and "
"directly type it, or you can use any of the available inputs and values "
"(remember that some algorithms generate single numerical values. We will "
"see more about this soon). In the case of a string parameter, you will "
"also see string inputs and you will be able to select one of them or type"
" the desired fixed value."

"The model is now complete. Try to run it using the DEM that we have used "
