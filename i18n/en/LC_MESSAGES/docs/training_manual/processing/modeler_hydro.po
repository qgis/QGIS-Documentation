"The first model that we created in the previous chapter was a very simple "
"one, with just one input and 3 algorithms. More complex models can be "
"created, with different types of inputs and containing more step. For this "
"chapter we will work with a model that creates a vector layer with "
"watersheds, based on a DEM and a threshold value. That will be very useful "
"for calculating several vector layers corresponding to different thresholds,"
" without having to repeat each single step each time."

"This lesson does not contain instructions about how to create you model. You"
" already know the necessary steps (we saw them in a previous lesson) and you"
" have already seen the basic ideas about the modeler, so you should try it "
"yourself. Spend a few minutes trying to create your model, and don't worry "
"about making mistakes. Remember: first add the inputs and then add the "
"algorithms that use them to create the workflow."

"In case you could not create the full model yourself and you need some extra"

"finished version of it. Open the modeler and then open the model file that "
"you will find in the data folder. You should see something like this."

"This model contains all the steps needed to complete the calculation, but it"
" just has one input: the DEM That means that the threshold for channel "
"definition use a fixed value, which makes the model not as useful as it "
"could be. That is not a problem, since we can edit the model, and that is "
"exactly what we will do."

"The input that we have just added is not used, so the model hasn't actually "

"case the *Channel network* one. To edit an algorithm that already exists in "

"The dialog is filled with the current values used by the algorithm. You can "
"see that the threshold parameter has a fixed value of 1,000,000 (this is "
"also the default value of the algorithm, but any other value could be put in"
" there). However, you might notice that the parameter is not entered in a "
"common text box, but in an option menu. If you unfold it, you will see "

"The input that we added is there and we can select it. Whenever an algorithm"
" in a model requires a numerical value, you can hardcode it and directly "
"type it, or you can use any of the available inputs and values (remember "
"that some algorithms generate sinlge numerical values. We will see more "
"about this soon). In the case of a string parameter, you will also see "
"string inputs and you will be able to select on of them or type the desired "
