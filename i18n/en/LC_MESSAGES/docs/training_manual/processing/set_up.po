"The first thing to do before using the processing framework is to "
"configure it. There is not much to set-up, so this is an easy task."

msgid ""
"Later on we will show how to configure the external applications that are"
" used for extending the list of available algorithms, but for now we are "
"just going to work with the framework itself."

"The processing framework is a core QGIS plugin, which means that, if you "
"are running QGIS 2.0 or later, it should already be installed in your "
"system, since it is included with QGIS. In case it is active, you should "
"see a menu called *Processing* in your menu bar. There you will find an "
"access to all the framework components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:23
msgid ""
"If you cannot find that menu, you have to enable the plugin by going to "
"the plugin manager and activating it."

"The main element that we are going to work with is the toolbox. Click on "
"the corresponding menu entry and you will see the toolbox docked at the "
"right side of the QGIS window."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:35
msgid ""
"The toolbox contains a list of all the available algorithms, divided in "
"groups so called *Providers*. Providers can be (de)activated in the "
"settings dialog. A label in the bottom part of the toolbox will remind "
"you of that whenever there are inactive providers. Use the link in the "
"label to open the settings window and set up providers. We will discuss "
"the settings dialog later in this manual."

msgid ""
"By default, only providers that do not rely on third-party applications "
"(that is, those that only require QGIS elements to be run) are active. "
"Algorithms requiring external applications might need additional "
"configuration. Configuring providers is explained in a later chapter in "
"this manual."

"If you have reached this point, now you are ready to use geoalgorithms. "
"There is no need to configure anything else by now. We can already run "
"our first algorithm, which we will do in the next lesson."
