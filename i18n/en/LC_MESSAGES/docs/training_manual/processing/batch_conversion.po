msgid "The batch processing interface"

"This lesson introduces the batch processing interface, which allows to "
"execute a single algorithm with a set of different input values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:10
msgid ""
"Sometimes a given algorithm has to be executed repeteadly with different "
"inputs. This is, for instance, the case when a set of input files have to"
" be converted from one format to another, or when several layers in a "
"given projection must be converted into another projection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:12
msgid ""
"In that case, calling the algorithm repeatedly on the toolbox is not the "
"best option. Instead, the batch processing interface should be used, "
"which greatly simplifies performing a multiple execution of a given "
"algorithm. To run an algorithm as a batch process, find it in the "
"toolbox, and instead of double--clicking on it, right--click on it and "
"select *Run as batch process*."
msgstr ""

"For this example, we will use the *Reproject algorithm*, so find it and "
"do as described above. You will get to the following dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have a look at the data for this lesson, you will see that it "
"contains a set of three shapefiles, but no QGIS project file. This is "
"because, when an algorithm is run as a batch process, layer inputs can be"
" selected either from the current QGIS project or from files. That makes "
"it easier to process large amounts of layers, such as, for instance, all "
"the layers in a given folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:22
msgid ""
"Each row in the table of the batch processing dialog represents a single "
"execution of the algorithm. Cells in a row correspond to the parameter "
"needed by the algorithm, which are not arranged one above the other, as "
"in the normal single--execution dialog, but horizontally in that row."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:24
msgid ""
"Defining the batch process to run is one by filling the table with the "
"corresponding values, and the dialog itself contains several tools to "
"make this task easier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:26
msgid ""
"Let's start filling the fields one by one. The first column to fill is "
"the *Input layer* one. Instead of entering the names of each one of the "
"layers we want to process, you can select all of them and let the dialog "
"put one in each row. Click on the button in the upper-left cell, and in "
"the file selection dialog that will popup, select the three files to "
"reproject. Since only one of them is needed for each row, the remaining "
"ones will be used to fill the rows underneath."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:30
msgid ""
"The default number of rows is 3, which is exactly the number of layers we"
" have to convert, but if you select more layers, new rows will be added "
"automatically. If you want to fill the entries manually, you can add more"
" rows using the *Add row* button."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:32
msgid ""
"We are going to convert all those layers to the EPSG:23029 CRS, so we "
"have to select that CRS in the second field. We want the same on for all "
"rows, but we do not have to do it for every single row. Instead, set that"
" CRS for the first row (the one at the top) using the button in the "
"corresponding cell, and then double click on the column header. That "
"causes all the cells in the column to be filled using the value of the "
"top cell."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:36
msgid ""
"Finally, we have to select an output file for each execution, which will "
"contain the corresponding reprojected layer. Once again, let's do it just"
" for the first row. Click on the button in the upper cell and, in a "
"folder where you want to put your output files, enter a filename (for "
"instance, ``reprojected.shp``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:38
msgid ""
"Now, when you click *OK* on the file selection dialog, the file does not "
"automatically gets written to the cell, but an input box like the "
"following one is shown instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:42
msgid ""
"If you select the first option, only the current cell will be filled. If "
"you select any of the other ones, all the rows below will be filled with "
"a given pattern. In this case, we are going to select the *Fill with "
"parameter value* option, and then the *Input Layer* value in the drop "
"down menu below. That will cause the value in the *Input Layer* (that is,"
" the layer name) to be added to the filename we have added, making each "
"output filename different. The batch processing table should now look "
"like this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:46
msgid ""
"The last column sets whether or not to add the resulting layers to the "
"current QGIS project. Leave the default *Yes* option, so you can see your"
" results in this case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/batch_conversion.rst:48
msgid ""
"Click on *OK* and the batch process will be run. If everything went fine,"
" all your layers will have been processed, and 3 new layers would have "
"been created."
