"The iterative execution of algorithms is available not just for built-in "
"algorithms, but also for the algorithms that you can create yourself, "
"such as models. We are going to see how to combine a model and the "
"iterative execution of algorithms, so we can obtain more complex results "
"with ease."

"The data the we are going to use for this lesson is the same one that we "
"already used for the last one. In this case, instead of just clipping the"
" DEM with each watershed polygon, we will add some extra steps and "
"calculate a hypsometric curve for each of them, to study how elevation is"
" distributed within the watershed."

"Since we have a workflow that involves several steps (clipping + "
"computing the hypsometric curve), we should go to the modeler and create "
"the corresponding model for that workflow."

"You can find the model already created in the data folder for this "
"lesson, but it would be good if you first try to create it yourself. The "
"clipped layer is not a final result in this case, since we are just "
"interested in the curves, so this model will not generated any layers, "
"but just a table with the curve data."

"We can make this example more complex by extending the model and "
"computing some slope statistics. Add the *Slope, aspect, curvature* "
"algorithm to the model, and then the *Raster statistics* algorithm, which"
" should use the slope output as its only input."

"If you now run the model, apart from the tables you will get a set of "
