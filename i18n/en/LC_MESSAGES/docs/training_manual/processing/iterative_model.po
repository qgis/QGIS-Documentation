"The iterative execution of algorithms is available not just for built-in "
"algorithms, but also for the algorithms that you can create your self, such "
"as models. We are going to see how to combine a model and the iterative "
"execution of algorithms, so we can obtain more complex results with ease."

"The data the we are going to use for this lesson is the same one that we "
"already used for the last one. In this case, instead of just clipping the "
"DEM with each watershed polygon, we will add some extra steps and calculate "
"a hypsometric curve for each of them, to study how elevation is distributed "
"within the watershed."

"Since we have a workflow that involves several stapes (clipping + computing "
"the hypsometric curve), we shouldgo to the modeler and create the "
"corresponding model for that workflow."

"You can find the model already created in the data folder for this lesson, "
"but it would be good if you first try to create it yourself. The clipped "
"layer is not a final result in this case, since we are just interested in "
"the curves, so this model will not generated any layers, but just a table "
"with the curve data."

"We can make this example more complex by extending the model and computing "
"some slope statistics. Add the *Slope, aspect, curvatures* algorithm to the "
"model, and then the *Raster statistics* algorithm, which should use the "
"slope output as its only input."

"If you now run the model, apart from the tables you will get a set of pages "
