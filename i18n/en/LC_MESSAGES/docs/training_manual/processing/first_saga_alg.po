"In this lesson we will see how to use algorithms that depend on a third-"

"All the algorithms that we have run so far are part of processing framework."
" That is, they are *native* algorithms implemented in the plugin and run by "
"QGIS just like the plugin itself is run. However, one of the greatest "
"features of the processing framework is that it can use algorithms from "
"external application and extend the possibilites of those applications. Such"
" algorithms are wrapped and included in the toolbox, so you can easily use "
"them from QGIS, and use QGIS data to run them."

"Some of the algorithms that you see in the simplified view require third "
"party applications to be installed in your system. One algorithm provider of"
" special interest is SAGA (System for Automated Geospatial Analysis). At the"
" end of this lesson we will run an algorithm called *Convergence index*, "
"which is provided by SAGA and computes a morphometrical measurement from a "
"DEM. But first, we need to configure everything so QGIS can correctly call "
"SAGA. This is not difficult, but it's important to understand how it works. "
"Each external application has its own configuration, and later in this same "
"manual we will talk about some of the other ones, but SAGA is going to be "
"our main backend, so we will discuss it here."

"If you are on Windows, the best way to work with external algorithms is to "
"install QGIS using the OSGeo4W installer. It will take care of installing "
"all the needed dependencies, including SAGA, so if you have used it, there "
"is nothing else to do. You can open the settings dialog and go to the "
"*Providers/SAGA* group."

"If you have installed QGIS not using the OSGeo4W installer, then you must "

"In case you are using Linux, you do not have to set the path to your SAGA "
"installation in the processing configuration. Instead, you must install SAGA"
" and make sure that the SAGA folder is in PATH, so it can be called from the"
" console (just open a console and type ``saga_cmd`` to check it). Under "
"Linux, the target version for SAGA is also 2.1, but in some installations "
"(such as the OSGeo Live DVD) you might have just 2.0.8 available. There are "
"some 2.1 packages available, but they are not commonly installed and might "
"have some issues, so if you prefer to use the more common and stable 2.0.8, "
"you can do it by enabling 2.0.8 compatibility in the configuration dialog, "
"under the *SAGA* group"

"Once SAGA is installed, you can launch a SAGA algorithm double clicking on "
"its name, as with any other algorithm. Since we are using the simplified "
"interface, you do not know which algorithms are based on SAGA or in another "
"external application, but if you happen to double--click on one of them and "
"the corresponding application is not installed, you will see something like "
"this."

"If all goes fine, you will not notice any difference between this SAGA--"
"based algorithm and one of the others that we have previously run. However, "
"SAGA might, for some reason, not be able to produce a result and not "
