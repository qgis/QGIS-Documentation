"CRS's are a great source of confusion for QGIS Processing users, so here are"

"If there are input layers, it will use the CRS of the first layer. This is "
"assumed to be the CRS of all input layers, since they should have the same "
"one. If you use layers with unmatching CRS's, QGIS will warn you about it. "
"Notice that the CRS of input layers is shown along with its name in the "
"parameters dialog."

"Open the project corresponding to this lesson and you will see two layers "
"named 23030 and 4326. They both contain the same points, but in different "
"CRSs (EPSG:23030 and EPSG:4326). They appear in the same place because QGIS "
"is reprojecting on the fly to the project CRS (EPSG:4326), but they are not "
"actually the same layer."

"This algorithm add new columns to the attributes table of a vector layer. "

"In the list of available layers that you will find in the input layer field,"

"The other parameter of the algorithm allows to set how the algorithm uses "
"coordinates to calculate the new value that it will add to the resulting "
"layers. Most algorithms do not have an option like that, and just use the "
"coordinates directly. Select the *Layer CRS* option to just use coordinates "
"as they are. This is how almost all geoalgorithms work."

"You should get a new layer with exactly the same points as the other two "
"layers. If you right click on the name of the layer and open its properties,"

"Those coordinate values are given in the layer CRS, since we chose that "
"option. However, even if you choose another option, the output CRS of the "
"layer would have been the same, since the input CRS is used to set the CRS "
"of the output layer. Choosing another option will cause the values to be "
"different, but not the resulting point to change or the CRS of the ouput "
"layer to be different to the CRS of the input one."

"What should you learn from this? The main idea behind these examples is that"
" geoalgorithms use the layer as it is in its original data source, and "
"completely ignore the reprojections that QGIS might be doing before "
"rendering. In other words, do not trust what you see in the canvas, but "
"always have in mind that the original data will be used. That is no so "
"important in this case, since we are just using one single layer at a time, "
"but in an algorithm that needs several of them (such as a clip algorithm), "
"layers that appear to match or overlay might be very far one from each "
"other, since they might have different CRSs."

"Algorithms performs no reprojection (except in the reprojection algorithm "

"An interesting module that deals with CRS's is the reprojection one. It "

"Select any of the layers as input, and select EPSG:23029 as the destination "
"CRS. Run the algorithm and you will get a new layer, identical to the input "
"one, but with a different CRS. It will appear on the same region of the "
"canvas, like the other ones, since QGIS will reproject it on the fly, but "
"its original coordinates are different. You can see that by running the *Add"
" geometry columns* algorithm using this new layer as input, and veryfing "
"that the added coordinates are different to the ones in the attribute tables"
" of both of the two layers that we had computed before."
