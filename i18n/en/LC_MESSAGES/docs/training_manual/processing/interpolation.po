"In this lesson, we are going to interpolate points data to obtain a raster "
"layer. Before doing it, we will have to do some data preparation, and after "
"interpolating we will add some extra processing to modify the resulting "
"layer, so we will have a complete analysis routine."

"The data correspond to crop yield data, as produced by a modern harvester, "
"and we will use it to get a raster layer of crop yield. We do not plan to do"
" any further analysis with that layer, but just to use it as a background "
"layer for easily identifying the most productive areas and also those where "
"productivity can be improved."

"The first thing to do is to clean--up the layer, since it contains redundant"
" points. These are caused by the movement of the harvester, in places where "
"it has to do a turn or it changes its speed for some reason. The *Point "
"filter* algorithm will be useful for this. We will use it twice, to remove "
"points that can be considered outliers both in the upper and lower part of "
"the distribution."

"The final filter layer, with a reduced set of points, should look similar to"

"The *Filtered points* layer refers to the resulting one of the second "
"filter. It has the same name as the one produced by the first filter, since "
"the name is assigned by the algorithm, but you should not use the first one."
