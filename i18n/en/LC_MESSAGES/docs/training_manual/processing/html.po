"All the outputs we have produced so far were layers (whether raster or "
"vector). However, some algorithms generate outputs in the form of text "
"and graphics. All this outputs are wrapped in HTML files and displayed in"
" the so--called *Results viewer*, which is another element of the "
"processing framework."

"The algorithm is rather simple, and you just have to select the layer to "
"use and one of its field (a numeric one). The output is of type HTML, but"
" the corresponding box works exactly like the one that you can find in "
"the case of a raster or vector output. You can enter a filepath or leave "
"it blank to save to a temporary file. In this case, however, only the "
"``html`` and ``htm`` extensions are allowed, so there is no way of "
"altering the output format by using a different one."

"Run the algorithm selecting the only layer in the project as input, and "
"the *POP2000* field, and a new dialog like the one shown next will appear"
" once the algorithm is executed and the parameters dialog is closed."

"This is the *Results viewer*. It keeps all the HTML result generated "
"during the current session, easily accessible, so you can check them "
"quickly whenever you need it. As it happens with layers, if you have "
"saved the output to a temporary file, it will be deleted once you close "
"QGIS. If you have saved to a non-temporary path, the file will remain, "
"but it will not appear in the *Results viewer* the next time you open "
"QGIS."

"Some algorithms generate text that cannot be divided into other more "
"detailed outputs. That is the case if, for instance, the algorithm "
"captures the text output from an external process. In other cases, the "
"output is presented as text, but internally is divided into several "
"smaller outputs, usually in the form of numeric values. The algorithm "
"that we have just executed is one of them. Each one of those values is "
"handled as a single output, and stored in a variable. This has no "
"importance at all now, but once we move to the graphical modeler, you "
"will see that it will allow us to use those values as numeric inputs for "
"other algorithms."
