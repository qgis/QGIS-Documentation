"easy to read and understand for someone who's unfamiliar with the data? "
"If I saw this map on the Internet, or on a poster, or in a magazine, "
"would it capture my attention? Would I want to read this map if it wasn't"

"If this course is being presented to you, the course presenter may "
"require you to submit a final version of your map, exported to PDF, for "
"evaluation. If you're doing this course by yourself, it's recommended "
"that you evaluate your own map using the same criteria. Your map will be "
"evaluated on the overall appearance and symbology of the map itself, as "
"well as the appearance and layout of the map page and elements.  Remember"
" that the emphasis for evaluating the appearance of maps will always be "
"*ease of use*. The nicer the map is to look at and the easier it is to "
"understand at a glance, the better."
