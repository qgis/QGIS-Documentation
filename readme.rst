Introduction
============

This repository is meant to write and manage the Official Documentation of
`QGIS <https://qgis.org>`_, a free and Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS)
Software, under the `Open Source Geospatial (OSGeo) <https://www.osgeo.org>`_ foundation umbrella.

QGIS is developed using the Qt toolkit, C++ and Python and runs on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.
It is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 or greater.
Source files at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.

QGIS aims to be an easy to use GIS, providing common functions and features. QGIS supports a number
of raster, vector and mesh data formats, as well as important web service
protocols, such as WMS, WFS and WCS. Support for new formats and
protocols can easily be added using the plugin architecture.
More information and download link at https://qgis.org.

QGIS documentation is available at https://docs.qgis.org:

* The latest stable documentation and translations are on https://docs.qgis.org/latest and its PDF versions
  are available at https://docs.qgis.org/latest/pdf.
* The ongoing work for future releases is published as QGIS Testing Documentation.
  It's built from the ``master`` branch and NOT translated. QGIS Testing Documentation
  is on https://docs.qgis.org/testing and https://docs.qgis.org/testing/pdf/

Documentation is published for every long term release and is available for QGIS
`3.10 <https://docs.qgis.org/3.10>`_,
`3.4 <https://docs.qgis.org/3.4>`_,
`2.18 <https://docs.qgis.org/2.18>`_,
`2.14 <https://docs.qgis.org/2.14>`_,
`2.6 <https://docs.qgis.org/2.6>`_,
`2.2 <https://docs.qgis.org/2.2>`_,
`2.0 <https://docs.qgis.org/2.0>`_
and `1.8 <https://docs.qgis.org/1.8>`_.
Translations and PDF versions are also provided.

The documentation web site contents and the PDFs are generated using
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_,
based on `restructured text sources (rst) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
and html (jinja2) templates.

Most sources are in source/docs. Only frontpage and landing pages are in theme/qgis-theme

Styling is in theme/qgis-theme. This theme is used for website and documentation builds.
The website version is the canonical one.

Partial / faster building
=========================

Because of the size of the documentation, the building of the full docs can take up a long time.

You can decide to only build certain parts of the documentation by editing the source/conf.py file.

Uncomment the lines for the modules that you do NOT want to build in this part of source/conf.py:

.. code-block:: py

 # List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
 # directories to ignore when looking for source files.
 exclude_patterns = ['../output', "../i18n", "../resources", "../scripts"]
 # for faster builds, you can exclude certain parts from the build
 # uncomment one or more lines below, or construct such line yourself
 # uncomment to exclude the processing algs from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/user_manual/processing_algs/*']
 # uncomment to exclude the user manual from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/user_manual/*']
 # uncomment to exclude training manual from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/training_manual/*']
 # uncomment to exclude dev guides from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/developers_guide/*']
 # uncomment to exclude doc guides from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/documentation_guidelines/*']
 # uncomment to exclude gentle intro  from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/gentle_gis_introduction/*']
 # uncomment to exclude pyqgis dev book from build
 #exclude_patterns += ['docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/*']


Building the documentation using Make
=====================================

Building is only tested on Linux systems using make, on windows we now started a Paver setup (see below)

* ``make -f venv.mk html`` to build the english language
* ``make -f venv.mk LANG=nl html`` to build the dutch version

Note that with option ``-f venv.mk``, ``make`` will create and use a Python3 virtual environment with
required dependencies in ``/venv`` folder on the fly. Once created you can activate this virtual environment
using:

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate

No need to use option ``-f venv.mk`` after that.

Speed up the documentation build
--------------------------------

Running ``make html`` generates **from scratch** the full english documentation.
You can see from the output that after it removes the content from static it runs the
``sphinx-build -nW -b html -d output/doctrees  -D language=en -A language=en source output/html/en`` command.
If you change something in the documentation source and you want to preview the changes you shouldn't reuse
``make html`` command as it will fully rebuild everything. This takes a lot of time.
It's far better to use the ``sphinx-build`` command so it only builds the parts from the files that have been
changed. This ensures a very short build time (several seconds). Pay attention that if you add images in the
``resources`` directory they won't be copied  into the ``static`` directory if you don't use the ``make``
command. This means that your ``sphinx-build`` command won't find the new images. If you still want to build
fast you should copy the new images from ``resources`` to their corresponding location under ``static``.
Keep in mind that different options of the ``make`` command (presented down the page) are outputting different
``sphinx-build`` commands.

You should also be aware that the ``make ..`` commands are made for production purposes which translates that
the build will stop at the first inconsistency because of the ``sphinx-build -nW ..`` command. You should drop
the ``-W`` option if you want your build to fully complete (with warnings of course)
(e.g. ``sphinx-build -n -b html -d output/doctrees  -D language=en -A language=en source output/html/en``).


If you want add the QGIS-Documentation docs into the build, you either need
to manually copy the sources, resources and po files into the website project.
Or use the fullhtml target of make (which will checkout the branch):

.. code-block:: bash

    # to build english:
    make fullhtml
    # to build eg dutch:
    make LANG=nl fullhtml

Trying to build a fullhtml you might get an Exception: ``No user credentials found for host https://www.transifex.com``.
To fix this, add a ``~/.transifexrc`` file stored in the user's home directory with following information::

    [https://www.transifex.com]
    username = user
    token =
    password = p@ssw0rd
    hostname = https://www.transifex.com

To gather new strings in a pot (.po) file for your language, and merge them with
existing translations in the po files (normally to be run by your language maintainer):

.. code-block:: bash

  make pretranslate LANG=xx  # where xx is your language code

To add a new language (the scripts will need some directory structure):

.. code-block:: bash

  make createlang LANG=xx

See the website in action: http://www.qgis.org

Building PDF
------------

You will need to install **texi2pdf** by doing:

.. code-block:: bash
   
  # On Debian based systems
  sudo apt-get install texinfo
  # On Fedora based systems
  sudo yum install texinfo-tex

Alike the html build command, you need to run make with the option to build pdf
(pdf also builds the html output):

.. code-block:: bash

 make LANG=xx pdf


Building the Documentation using Docker
=======================================

Docker is an open platform for distributed applications for developers and
sysadmins (https://www.docker.com/).

Docker can be used on Linux, MacOS  and Windows.

In order to use a Docker instance to build the documentation, you can use
one of the scripts provided with QGIS-Documentation. The image will be installed
if not already present.

#. install Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
#. go to your local QGIS-Documentation repository to build the doc:

   .. code-block:: bash

    cd QGIS-Documentation/
    ./docker-run.sh LANG=fr html

Building the Documentation using Paver
======================================

`Paver <https://pypi.org/project/Paver/>`_ is a Python based Make-like tool.
It can be used on Linux and Windows (somebody can test on macOS?)

There are two scripts available in the repository:

- ``bootstrap.py`` (for setting up the python related stuff)
- ``pavement.py`` (the config file for Paver that generates the bootstrap file)

.. note:: QGIS-Documentation is based on Python 3. Depending on the flavor
 of your OS, you may need to replace ``python`` with ``python3`` in the
 following code samples.
 
General use:

#. First, install Paver (see https://pypi.org/project/Paver/#files)
#. Move to the QGIS-Documentation root folder

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd path/to/QGIS-Documentation

#. Use the ``bootstrap.py`` file to install all stuff.

   .. code-block:: bash

     python bootstrap.py

   .. I'm commenting this yet. easy_install is deprecated and we should not
      advise its use. 
      
      If the script is complaining about easysetup missing:
    
      #. download: http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html
      #. and install that first:

         .. code-block:: bash

         python ez_setup.py

   After successful running of bootstrap.py you have all wheels on place,
   the script has created a virtual environment (a folder called "virtualenv")
   with all Sphinx related python machinery.

#. Now you need to activate the virtual environment with all Sphinx related
   python machinery. To go into the virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # on Windows:
      virtualenv\Scripts\activate
      # on Linux:
      source virtualenv/bin/activate   

#. Run the actual script to build the documentation
   (Make sure that you are in the QGIS-Documentation root folder):
      
   .. code-block:: bash

      # english only
      paver html

   A ``build`` folder is now added in the repository, and under a ``html/en`` sub-folder,
   you'll find all the necessary html files of the docs.
#. To be able to build localized versions of the Documentation with paver the
   `Transifex-client (tx) <https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client>`_
   is needed. Remember that only QGIS stable branch is being translated.

   #. Install with:

      .. code-block:: bash

       pip install transifex-client

      On Windows, you can also download it from:
      https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/releases/download/0.13.6/tx.py36.x64.exe
      Then, to make ``tx.exe`` usable in the paver script, either put it IN this directory
      next to the ``pavement.py`` file, OR add it to your PATH.

   #. **IMPORTANT**: To be able to pull from transifex.com, you will need a credentials file.
      This file should be named: ``.transifexrc`` and easiest is to put it in your home dir
      (eg, on Windows, C:\\users\\you).
      Another option is to put it in the root of this project, but be careful to not put your
      credentials in Github :-)

      The file should contain this::

       [https://www.transifex.com]
       hostname = https://www.transifex.com
       password = yourtransifexpassword
       token =
       username = yourtransifexusername

   #. With a working tx and a .transifexrc, you should be able to build
      for example the german version of docs via:

      .. code-block:: bash

       # german:
       paver html -l de

      During the build you will see this command:

      .. code-block:: bash

       tx pull --minimum-perc=1 --skip -f -l de

      This will pull all german po files from transifex (based on the
      .tx/config file in the root of this project)


Building the Documentation using Windows - minimal setup
========================================================
Prerequisites:

- Python 3.5 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- Pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- Virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)

#. Create a local copy of **your** QGIS doc repository.
 
   .. code-block:: bash

     $ git clone https://github.com/<YourName>/QGIS-Documentation.git

#. Create a virtual environment, e.g., *venv* in the folder just created 
   (*QGIS-Documentation*).

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cd QGIS-Documentation
     $ Virtualenv venv
  
#. Activate the virtual environment. 
   On Windows, virtualenv creates a batch file that can be located at:
   
   venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat. 
   
   Using the Command Prompt just run this script as follows: 

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ activate.bat

   This script will modify your shell prompt to indicate which environment is currently active.  

#. Install the required packages for locally building the QGIS documentation executing:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt . 

#. Now you are ready to build the QGIS documentation locally. To do that you run the following sphinx command:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ sphinx-build -M html source build

   This will generate the documentation locally in ..\\QGIS-Documentation\\build\\html\\docs.

Testing Python snippets
=======================

To test Python code snippets, you need a *QGIS* installation, for this there are many options:

You can use your system *QGIS* installation with *Sphinx* from Python virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   make -f venv.mk doctest

You can use a manually built installation of *QGIS*, to do so, you need to create a custom ``Makefile``
extension on top of the ``venv.mk`` file, for example a ``user.mk`` file with the following content:

.. code-block:: mk

  # Root installation folder
  QGIS_PREFIX_PATH = /home/user/apps/qgis-master

  # Or build output folder
  QGIS_PREFIX_PATH = /home/user/dev/QGIS-build-master/output

  include venv.mk

Then use it to run target ``doctest``:

.. code-block:: bash

   make -f user.mk doctest

Or you can run target ``doctest`` inside the official *QGIS* docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

  make -f docker.mk doctest

Note that only code blocks with directive ``testcode`` are tested and it is possible to run tests setup code
which does not appear in documentation with directive ``testsetup``, for example:

.. code-block:: py

 .. testsetup::

     from qgis.core import QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem

 .. testcode::

     # PostGIS SRID 4326 is allocated for WGS84
     crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326, QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.PostgisCrsId)
     assert crs.isValid()

For more information see *Sphinx* doctest extension documentation:
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html


Translating the English QGIS Documentation
==========================================

Translating of the Documentation is handled via transifex: http://www.transifex.com

ONLY the current stable branch is translated.

If you want to help translating: create an account and join one of the translation
teams of the qgis project: https://www.transifex.com/organization/qgis

Every language has it's own maintainer, please contact them, if you want to help.
You find a list of current language maintainers at the end of this document. If
your language is not listed, please contact the `QGIS-Community-Team Mailinglist
<http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team>`_ and ask for help.
