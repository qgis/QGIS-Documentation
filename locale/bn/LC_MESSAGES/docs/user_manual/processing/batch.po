"All algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. That "
"is, they can be executed using not just a single set of inputs, but several "
"of them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is useful "
"when processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary to launch "
"the algorithm many times from the toolbox."

"To execute an algorithm as a batch process, right-click on its name in the "

"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an "
"algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not"
" just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for "
"each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a "
"table like the one shown next."

"Each line of this table represents a single execution of the algorithm, and "
"each cell contains the value of one of the parameters. It is similar to the "
"parameters dialog that you see when executing an algorithm from the toolbox,"
" but with a different arrangement."

"Filenames for input data objects are introduced directly typing or, more "
"conveniently, clicking on the :guilabel:`...` button on the right hand of "
"the cell, which will show a context menu with two option: one for selecting "
"from the layers currently opened and another to select from the filesystem. "
"This second option, when selected, shows a typical file chooser dialog. "
"Multiple files can be selected at once. If the input parameter represents a "
"single data object and several files are selected, each one of them will be "
"put in a separate row, adding new ones if needed. If the parameter "
"represents a multiple input, all the selected files will be added to a "
"single cell, separated by semicolons (``;``)."

"Layer identifiers can be directly typed in the parameter text box. You can "
"enter the full path to a file or the name of a layer that is currently "
"loaded in the current QGIS project. The name of the layer will be "
"automatically resolved to its source path. Notice that, if several layers "
"have the same name, this might cause unexpected results due to ambiguity."

"Output data objects are always saved to a file and, unlike when executing an"

"If the default value ('Do not autocomplete') is selected, it will just put "
"the selected filename in the selected cell from the parameters table. If any"
" of the other options is selected, all the cells below the selected one will"
" be automatically filled based on a defined criteria. This way, it is much "
"easier to fill the table, and the batch process can be defined with less "
"effort."

"Automatic filling can be done by simply adding correlative numbers to the "
"selected file path, or by appending the value of another field at the same "
"row. This is particularly useful for naming output data objects according to"
" input ones."
