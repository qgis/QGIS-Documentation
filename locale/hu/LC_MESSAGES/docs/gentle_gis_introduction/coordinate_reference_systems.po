"When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However "

"has **advantages** and **disadvantages**. The best projection for a map "

"be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable distortions if used"
" to map the entire African continent, but may be an excellent choice for a "
"**large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. The properties of a map "

"If your goal in projecting a map is to accurately measure distances, you "

"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have"

"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for"

"out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "
"are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an "
"equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
"area projection results in **distortions of angular conformity** when "
"dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their"
" angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "
