"QGIS has some support for parsing of SQL-like expressions. Only a small "
"subset of SQL syntax is supported. The expressions can be evaluated either "
"as boolean predicates (returning True or False) or as functions (returning a"
" scalar value). See :ref:`vector_expressions` in the User Manual for a "
"complete list of available functions."
