"A Web Feature Service (WFS) provides its users with GIS data in formats that"
" can be loaded directly in QGIS. Unlike a WMS, which provides you only with "
"a map which you can't edit, a WFS gives you access to the features "
"themselves."

"A Web Feature Service returns the layer itself, not just a map rendered from"
" it. This gives you direct access to the data, meaning that you can change "
"its symbology and run analysis functions on it. However, this is at the cost"
" of much more data being transmitted. This will be especially obvious if the"
" layers you're loading have complicated shapes, a lot of attributes, or many"
" features; or even if you're just loading a lot of layers. WFS layers "
"typically take a very long time to load because of this."

"Although it is of possible to query a WFS layer after having loaded it, it's"

"For example, on the WFS server we're currently using, there is a layer "
"called :guilabel:`countries (excluding Antarctica)`. Let's say that we want "
"to know where South Africa is relative to the :guilabel:`south_poles_wfs` "
"layer (and perhaps also the :guilabel:`antarctica_country_border` layer) "
"that's already been loaded."

"There are two ways to do this. You can load the whole :guilabel:`countries "
"...` layer, and then build a query as usual once it's loaded. However, "
"transmitting the data for all the countries in the world and then only using"
" the data for South Africa seems a bit wasteful of bandwidth. Depending on "
"your connection, this dataset can take several minutes to load."

"It is rare to find a WFS hosting features you need, if your needs are very "
"specific. The reason why Web Feature Services are relatively rare is because"
" of the large amounts of data that must be transmitted to describe a whole "

" WMS, which sends only images."
