" does not have to enter or select them again next time the plugin is run."

"These variables can be saved and retrieved with help of Qt and QGIS API. For"
" each variable, you should pick a key that will be used to access the "
"variable --- for user's favourite color you could use key "
"\"favourite_color\" or any other meaningful string. It is recommended to "
"give some structure to naming of keys."

"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at a particular machine. "
"QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main window size "
"or default snapping tolerance. Settings are handled using the "
":class:`QgsSettings <qgis.core.QgsSettings>` class, through for example the "
":meth:`setValue() <qgis.core.QgsSettings.setValue>` and :meth:`value() "
"<qgis.core.QgsSettings.value>` methods."

"**project settings** --- vary between different projects and therefore they "
"are connected with a project file. Map canvas background color or "
"destination coordinate reference system (CRS) are examples --- white "
"background and WGS84 might be suitable for one project, while yellow "
"background and UTM projection are better for another one."

"As you can see, the :meth:`writeEntry() <qgis.core.QgsProject.writeEntry>` "

"data type."

"**map layer settings** --- these settings are related to a particular "
"instance of a map layer with a project. They are *not* connected with "
"underlying data source of a layer, so if you create two map layer instances "
"of one shapefile, they will not share the settings. The settings are stored "
"inside the project file, so if the user opens the project again, the layer-"
"related settings will be there again. The value for a given setting is "
"retrieved using the :meth:`customProperty() "
"<qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.customProperty>` method, and can be set using the "
":meth:`setCustomProperty() <qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty>` one."
