"Depending on the kind of plugin that you are going to develop, it might be a"
" better option to add its functionality as a Processing algorithm (or a set "
"of them). That would provide a better integration within QGIS, additional "
"functionality (since it can be run in the components of Processing, such as "
"the modeler or the batch processing interface), and a quicker development "
"time (since Processing will take of a large part of the work)."

"To distribute those algorithms, you should create a new plugin that adds "
"them to the Processing Toolbox. The plugin should contain an algorithm "
"provider, which has to be registered when the plugin is instantiated."
