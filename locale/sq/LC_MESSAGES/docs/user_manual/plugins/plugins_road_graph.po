"The Road Graph Plugin is a C++ plugin for QGIS that calculates the shortest "

"As a roads layer, you can use any polyline vector layer in any QGIS-"
"supported format. Two lines with a common point are considered connected. "
"Please note, it is required to use layer CRS as project CRS while editing a "
"roads layer. This is due to the fact that recalculation of the coordinates "
"between different CRSs introduces some errors that can result in "
"discontinuities, even when 'snapping' is used."
