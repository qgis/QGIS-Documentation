"Draw up a list of features in and around your school that you think would"
" be interesting to capture. For example: the school boundary, the "
"position of fire assembly points, the layout of each class room, and so "
"on. Try to use a mix of different geometry types. Now split your learners"
" into groups and assign each group a few features to capture. Have them "
"symbolise their layers so that they are more meaningful to look at. "
"Combine the layers from all the groups to create a nice map of your "
"school and its surroundings!"

"Find a local river and take water samples along its length. Make a "
"careful note of the position of each sample using a GPS or by marking it "
"on a toposheet. For each sample take measurements such as pH, dissolved "
"oxygen etc. Capture the data using the GIS application and make maps that"
" show the samples with a suitable symbology. Could you identify any areas"
" of concern? Was the GIS Application able to help you to identify these "
"areas?"

"If you don't have a computer available, you can follow the same process "
"by using transparency sheets and a notebook. Use an aerial photo, "
"orthosheet or satellite image printout as your background layer. Draw "
"columns down the page in your notebook and write in the column headings "
"for each attribute field you want to store information about. Now trace "
"the geometry of features onto the transparency sheet, writing a number "
"next to each feature so that it can be identified. Now write the same "
"number in the first column in your table in your notebook, and then fill "
"in all the additional information you want to record."
