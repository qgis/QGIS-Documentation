"Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of "
"paper in a way that, even without many words, the average person can "
"understand what it is all about. Maps are usually produced for "
"presentations and reports where the audience or reader is a politician, "
"citizen or a learner with no professional background in GIS. Because of "
"this, a map has to be effective in communicating spatial information. "
"Common elements of a map are the title, map body, legend, north arrow, "
"scale bar, acknowledgement, and map border (see "
":numref:`figure_map_elements`)."

"Other elements that might be added are e.g. a **graticule**, or **name of"

" to interpret the information shown on the map. The map body is, of "
"course, the most important part of the map because it contains the map "
"information. The other elements support the communication process and "
"help the map reader to orientate himself and understand the map topic. "
"For example, the title describes the subject matter and the legend "
"relates map symbols to the mapped data."

"A map is a simplified representation of the real world and **map "
"symbols** are used to represent real objects. Without symbols, we "

"map, a map legend is used to provide a key to all the symbols used on the"
" map. It is like a dictionary that allows you to understand the meaning "
"of what the map shows. A map legend is usually shown a a little box in a "
"corner of the map. It contains icons, each of which will represent a type"
" of feature. For example, a *house* icon will show you how to identify "
"houses on the map (see :numref:`figure_map_legend`)."

"The scale of a map, is the value of a single unit of distance on the map,"
" representing distance in the real world. The values are shown in map "
"units (meters, feet or degrees). The scale can be expressed in several "
"ways, for example, in words, as a ratio or as a graphical scale bar (see "
":numref:`figure_map_scale`)."
msgstr ""

"**Expressing a scale in words** is a commonly used method and has the "
"advantage of being easily understood by most map users. You can see an "
"example of a word based scale in a :numref:`figure_map_scale` (a). "
"Another option is the **representative fraction (RF)** method, where both"
" the map distance and the ground distance in the real world are given in "
"the same map units, as a ratio. For example, a RF value 1:25,000 means "
"that any distance on the map is 1/25,000 *th* of the real distance on the"
" ground (see :numref:`figure_map_scale` (b)). The value 25,000 in the "
"ratio is called the **scale denominator**. More experienced users often "
"prefer the representative fraction method, because it reduces confusion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/gentle_gis_introduction/map_production.rst:114
msgid ""
"When a representative fraction expresses a very small ratio, for example "
"1:1000 000, it is called a **small scale map**. On the other hand if the "
"ratio is very large, for example a 1:50 000 map, it is called a **large "
"scale map**. It is handy to remember that a small scale map covers a "
"**large area**, and a large scale map covers a **small area**!"

"A **scale expression as a graphic or bar scale** is another basic method "

"on the **map** by the **scale denominator**, you will know the distance "
"in the **real world**."

"Another interesting aspect of a map scale, is that the lower the map "
"scale, the more detailed the feature information in the map will be. In "
":numref:`figure_map_scale_compare`, you can see an example of this. Both "

"In the acknowledgment area of a map it is possible to add text with "

"how, by whom and when a map was created. If you look at a topographical "
"map of your town, it would be useful to know when the map was created and"
" who did it. If the map is already 50 years old, you will probably find a"
" lot of houses and roads that no longer exist or maybe never even "
