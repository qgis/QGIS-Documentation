"In the previous topics we have taken a closer look at vector data. While "
"vector features use geometry (points, polylines and polygons) to "
"represent the real world, raster data takes a different approach. Rasters"
" are made up of a matrix of pixels (also called cells), each containing a"
" value that represents the conditions for the area covered by that cell "
"(see :numref:`figure_raster`). In this topic we are going to take a "
"closer look at raster data, when it is useful and when it makes more "

"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display "
"information that is continuous across an area and cannot easily be "
"divided into vector features. When we introduced you to vector data we "
"showed you the image in :numref:`figure_landscape`. Point, polyline and "
"polygon features work well for representing some features on this "
"landscape, such as trees, roads and building footprints. Other features "
"on a landscape can be more difficult to represent using vector features. "
"For example the grasslands shown have many variations in colour and "
"density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a single polygon around"
" each grassland area, but a lot of the information about the grassland "
"would be lost in the process of simplifying the features to a single "
"polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature attribute values,"
" they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very good at "
"representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) all "
"over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "
"variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem "
"with that approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to"
" create a good vector dataset."

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster"
" data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to "
"provide more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very "
"good at interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, "
"results in maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for"
" images that depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and "
"aerial photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract "
"ideas. For example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an "
"area, or to depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of "
"applications, each cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. "
"risk of fire on a scale of one to ten."

"Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth's "

"information is stored with the digital version of the aerial photo. When "
"the GIS application opens the photo, it uses the positional information "
"to ensure that the photo appears in the correct place on the map. "
"Normally this positional information consists of a coordinate for the top"
" left pixel in the image, the size of each pixel in the X direction, the "
"size of each pixel in the Y direction, and the amount (if any) by which "
"the image is rotated. With these few pieces of information, the GIS "
"application can ensure that raster data are displayed in the correct "
"place. The georeferencing information for a raster is often provided in a"
" small text file accompanying the raster."

"Raster data can be obtained in a number of ways. Two of the most common "
"ways are aerial photography and satellite imagery. In aerial photography,"
" an aeroplane flies over an area with a camera mounted underneath it. The"
" photographs are then imported into a computer and georeferenced. "
"Satellite imagery is created when satellites orbiting the earth point "
"special digital cameras towards the earth and then take an image of the "
"area on earth they are passing over. Once the image has been taken it is "
"sent back to earth using radio signals to special receiving stations such"
" as the one shown in :numref:`figure_csir_station`. The process of "

"In other cases, raster data can be computed. For example an insurance "

"Sometimes raster data are created from vector data because the data "

"attributes, that users need to be aware of, can be represented on the map"

"table for the data, providing it in raster format could be a bad choice "

"Every raster layer in a GIS has pixels (cells) of a fixed size that "

"Several factors determine the spatial resolution of an image. For remote "
"sensing data, spatial resolution is usually determined by the "
"capabilities of the sensor used to take an image. For example SPOT5 "
"satellites can take images where each pixel is 10 m x 10 m. Other "
"satellites, for example MODIS take images only at 500 m x 500 m per "
"pixel. In aerial photography, pixel sizes of 50 cm x 50 cm are not "
"uncommon. Images with a pixel size covering a small area are called "
"'**high resolution**' images because it is possible to make out a high "
"degree of detail in the image. Images with a pixel size covering a large "

"In raster data that is computed by spatial analysis (such as the rainfall"

"One of the main things to be aware of with rasters captured at a high "
"spatial resolution is storage requirements. Think of a raster that is 3 x"
" 3 pixels, each of which contains a number representing average rainfall."
" To store all the information contained in the raster, you will need to "
"store 9 numbers in the computer's memory. Now imagine you want to have a "
"raster layer for the whole of South Africa with pixels of 1 km x 1 km. "
"South Africa is around 1,219,090 km :sup:`2`. Which means your computer "
"would need to store over a million numbers on its hard disk in order to "

"increase the amount of storage needed."

"Sometimes using a low spatial resolution is useful when you want to work "
"with a large area and are not interested in looking at any one area in a "
"lot of detail. The cloud maps you see on the weather report, are an "
