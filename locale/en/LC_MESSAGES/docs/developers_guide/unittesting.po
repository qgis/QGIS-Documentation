"There is some code you want to test, e.g. a class or function. Extreme "

"You create a unit test. This happens under ``<QGIS Source "

"Since we are combining both class declaration and implementation in a "

"All our test methods are implemented as private slots. The QtTest "

"the unit test (``cleanupTestCase``). Before each test method is called, "
"the ``init()`` method will be called and after each test method is called"

msgid ""
"In the first case we want to generally test if the various parts of the "
