"widget / item inside."

"Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and "

"Capitalize all words in Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so"

"all words, except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for "
"example, 'with' but 'Without'), conjunctions (for example, and, or, but),"

"Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon"
