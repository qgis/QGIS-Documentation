"The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during "
"the last years. Therefore it is hard to anticipate the side effects that "
"the addition of a feature will have. In the past, the QGIS project had "
"very long release cycles because it was a lot of work to reestablish the "
"stability of the software system after new features were added. To "
"overcome these problems, QGIS switched to a development model using the "
"`git <https://git-scm.com>`_ version control system: new features are "
"coded in the contributor branches first and merged to the QGIS master "
"(the main branch) when they are finished and stable."
