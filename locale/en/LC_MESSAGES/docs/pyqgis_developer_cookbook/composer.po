"There are generally two approaches when input data should be rendered as "

"Print layout is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "

"possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map views, labels, "
"legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on paper maps."

"printed on a printer."

"The layout consists of a bunch of classes. They all belong to the core "

"<https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html>`_, then you are encouraged to "
