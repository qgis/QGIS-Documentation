"The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and "
"perform complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the "
"other GUI elements of the processing framework. Models involving several "
"algorithms can be defined using the command-line interface, and "
"additional operations such as loops and conditional sentences can be "
"added to create more flexible and powerful workflows."

"There is not a processing console in QGIS, but all processing commands "
"are available instead from the QGIS built-in :ref:`Python console "

"The code that you can execute from the Python console, even if it does "

"Now, there is basically just one (interesting) thing you can do with that"

":meth:`run() <qgis.core.QgsProcessingAlgorithm.run>` method, which takes "
"the name of the algorithm to execute as its first parameter, and then a "
"variable number of additional parameters depending on the requirements of"
" the algorithm. So the first thing you need to know is the name of the "
"algorithm to execute. That is not the name you see in the toolbox, but "
"rather a unique command–line name. To find the right name for your "
"algorithm, you can use the :class:`processingRegistry "
