"The :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` is the main element of the processing "

"shows the list of all available **algorithms** grouped in different "
"blocks called *Providers*, and custom **models** and **scripts** you can "
"add to extend the set of tools. Hence the toolbox is the access point to "
"run them, whether as a single process or as a batch process involving "
