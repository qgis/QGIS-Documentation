"The *graphical modeler* allows you to create complex models using a "
"simple and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis "
"operations are not isolated, rather part of a chain of operations. Using "
"the graphical modeler, that chain of operations can be wrapped into a "
"single process, making it convenient to execute later with a different "
"set of inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms it "
"involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm, saving time and "

"You might notice that some algorithms that can be executed from the "
"toolbox do not appear in the list of available algorithms when you are "
"designing a model. To be included in a model, an algorithm must have the "
"correct semantic. If an algorithm does not have such a well-defined "
"semantic (for instance, if the number of output layers cannot be known in"
" advance), then it is not possible to use it within a model, and it will "
"not appear in the list of algorithms that you can find in the modeler "
"dialog."
