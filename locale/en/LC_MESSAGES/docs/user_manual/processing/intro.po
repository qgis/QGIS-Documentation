"There are four basic elements in the framework GUI, which are used to run"
" algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another will "

"batch processing interface, which is called from the toolbox or the "
"algorithm execution dialog, as we will see) can be accessed from the "
":menuselection:`Processing` menu item (you will see more entries; the "
