"GPS, the **Global Positioning System**, is a satellite-based system that "
"allows anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere "
"in the world. GPS is used as an aid in navigation, for example in "
"airplanes, in boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from"
" the satellites to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) "
"elevation. Most receivers also have the capability to store:"

"Since QGIS uses GPX files, you need a way to convert other GPS file "
"formats to GPX. This can be done for many formats using the free program "
"`GPSBabel <https://www.gpsbabel.org>`_. This program can also transfer "
"GPS data between your computer and a GPS device. QGIS relies on GPSBabel "
"to do these things and provides you with convenient Processing algorithms"

"GPS units allow you to store data in different coordinate systems. When "
"downloading a GPX file (from your GPS unit or a web site) and then "
"loading it in QGIS, be sure that the data stored in the GPX file uses WGS"
" 84 (latitude/longitude). QGIS expects this, and it is the official GPX "
"specification. See `GPX 1.1 Schema Documentation "
