"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that "
"allows anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere "
"in the world. GPS is used as an aid in navigation, for example in "
"airplanes, in boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from"
" the satellites to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) "
"elevation. Most receivers also have the capability to store locations "
"(known as **waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned "
"**route** and a tracklog or **track** of the receiver's movement over "
"time. Waypoints, routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in "
"GPS data. QGIS displays waypoints in point layers, while routes and "
"tracks are displayed in linestring layers."

"There are dozens of different file formats for storing GPS data. The "

"Since QGIS uses GPX files, you need a way to convert other GPS file "

"GPSBabel, which is available at https://www.gpsbabel.org. This program "
"can also transfer GPS data between your computer and a GPS device. QGIS "
"uses GPSBabel to do these things, so it is recommended that you install "
"it. However, if you just want to load GPS data from GPX files you will "
"not need it. Version 1.2.3 of GPSBabel is known to work with QGIS, but "
"you should be able to use later versions without any problems."
