"The |georefRun| Georeferencer is a tool for generating world files for "
"layers. It allows you to reference rasters or vectors to geographic or "
"projected coordinate systems by creating a new GeoTiff or by adding a "
"world file to the existing image. The basic approach to georeferencing a "
"layer is to locate points on it for which you can accurately determine "

"account for curvature or other systematic warping of the image, for "
"instance photographed maps with curving edges. At least 6 (respectively "
"10) GCP's are required. Angles and local scale are not preserved or "
