"While PostGIS is generally used on a server to provide spatial database "
"capabilities to multiple users at the same time, QGIS also supports the "
"use of a file format called *SpatiaLite* that is a lightweight, portable "
"way to store an entire spatial database in a single file. Obviously, "
"these 2 types of spatial databases should be used for different purposes,"
" but the same basic principles and techniques apply to both. Let's create"
" a new SpatiaLite database and explore the functionality provided to work"
" with these databases in QGIS."
