"Just like the manual of a word processor doesn't teach you how to write a"
" novel or a poem, or a CAD tutorial doesn't show you how to calculate the"
" size of a beam for a building, this guide will not teach you spatial "
"analysis. Instead, it will show you how to use the QGIS Processing "
"framework, a powerful tool for performing spatial analysis. It is up to "
"you to learn the required concepts that are needed to understand that "
"type of analysis. Without them, there is no point in using the framework "
"and its algorithms, although you might be tempted to try."

"Given a set of points and a value of a given variable value at each "
"point, you can calculate a raster layer from them using the *Kriging* "
"geoalgorithm. The parameters dialog for that module is like the following"
" one."

"By reading this manual, you will learn things such as how to use that "
"module, how to run it in a batch process to create raster layers from "
"hundreds of points layers in a single run, or what happens if the input "
"layer has some points selected. However, the parameters themselves are "
"not explained. A seasoned analyst with a good knowledge of geostatistics "
"will have no problem understanding those parameters. If you are not one "
"of them and *sill*, *range*, or *nugget* are not familiar concepts to "
"you, then you should not use the *Kriging* module. More than that, you "
"are far from being ready to use the *Kriging* module, since it requires "
"learning about concepts such as spatial autocorrelation or "
"semivariograms, which probably you also haven't heard before, or at least"
" haven't studied long enough. You should first study and understand them,"
" and then come back to QGIS to actually run it and perform the analysis. "
"Ignoring this will result in wrong results and poor (and most likely "
"useless) analysis."

"Although not all algorithms are as complex as kriging (but some of them "
"are even more complex!), almost all of them require understanding the "
"fundamental analysis ideas that they are based on. Without that "
"knowledge, using them will most likely lead to poor results."

"Using geoalgorithms without having a good foundation of spatial analysis "
"is like trying to write a novel without knowing anything about grammar or"
" syntax, and having no knowledge about storytelling. You might get a "
"result, but it is likely to have no value at all.  Please, don't fool "
"yourself and think that after reading this guide you are already capable "
"of performing spatial analysis and get sound results. You need to study "
"spatial analysis as well."
