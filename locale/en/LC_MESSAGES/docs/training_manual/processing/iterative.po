"This lesson shows a different way of executing algorithms that use vector"
" layers, by running them repeatedly, iterating over the features in an "
"input vector layer"

"We already know the model designer, which is one way of automating "
"processing tasks. However, in some situations, the modeler might not be "
"what we need to automate a given task. Let's see one of those situations "
"and how to easily solve it using a different functionality: the iterative"
" execution of algorithms."

"You will recognize our well-known DEM from previous chapters and a set of"
" watersheds extracted from it. Imagine that you need to cut the DEM into "
"several smaller layers, each of them containing just the elevation data "
"corresponding to a single watershed. That will be useful if you later "
"want to calculate some parameters related to each watershed, such as its "
"mean elevation or it hypsographic curve."

"This can be a lengthy and tedious task, especially if the number of "
"watersheds is large. However, it is a task that can be easily automated, "
"as we will see."

"The algorithm to use for clipping a raster layer with a polygon layer is "
"called *Clip raster with polygons*, and has the following parameters "

"You can run it using the watersheds layer and the DEM as input, and you "

"You can have the DEM clipped with just a single watershed by selecting "
"the desired watershed and then running the algorithm as we did before."

"Since only selected features are used, only the selected polygon will be "
"used to crop the raster layer."
msgstr ""

"Doing this for all the watersheds will produce the result we are looking "
"for, but it doesn't look like a very practical way of doing it. Instead, "
"let's see how to automate that *select and crop* routine."

"First of all, remove the previous selection, so all polygons will be used"
" again. Now open the *Clip raster with polygon* algorithm and select the "
"same inputs as before, but this time click on the button that you will "
"find in the right--hand side of the vector layer input where you have "
"selected the watersheds layer."

msgid ""
"This button will cause the selected input layer to be split into as many "
"layer as feature are found in it, each of them containing a single "
"polygon. With that, the algorithm will be called repeatedly, one for each"
" one of those single-polygon layers. The result, instead of just one "
"raster layer in the case of this algorithm, will be a set of raster "
"layers, each one of them corresponding to one of the executions of the "
"algorithm."

"For each layer, the black and white color palette, (or whatever palette "
"you are using), is adjusted differently, from its minimum to its maximum "
"values. That's the reason why you can see the different pieces and the "
"colors do not seem to match in the border between layers. Values, "
"however, do match."
