"For this lesson, we are going to modify the hydrological model that we "
"created in the last chapter (open it in the modeler before starting), so "
"we can automate the calculation of a valid threshold value and we do not "
"have to ask the user to enter it. Since that value refers to the variable"
" in the threshold raster layer, we will extract it from that layer, based"
" on some simple statistical analysis."

"Starting with the aforementioned model, let's do the following "
"modifications:"

"First, calculate statistics of the flow accumulation layer using the "
"*Raster layer statistics* algorithm."

"This will generate a set of statistical values that will now be available"

"If you edit the  *Channel network* algorithm, as we did in the last "
"lesson, you will see now that you have other options apart from the "
"numeric input that you added."

msgid ""
"However, none of this values is suitable for being used as a valid "
"threshold, since they will result in channel networks that will not be "
"very realistic. We can, instead, derive some new parameter based on them,"
" to get a better result. For instance, we can use the mean plus 2 times "
"the standard deviation."

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_hydro_calculator.rst:24
msgid ""
"To add that arithmetical operation, we can use the calculator that you "
"will find in the *Geoalgorithms/modeler/modeler-tools* group. This group "
"contains algorithms that are not very useful outside of the modeler, but "
"that provide some useful functionality when creating a model."

"As you can see, the dialog is different to the other ones we have seen, "
