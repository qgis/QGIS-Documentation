"Sometimes we need a simplified version of a vector, to have a smaller "
"file size and get rid of unnecessary details. Many tools do this in a "
"very rough way, and miss the adjacency and sometimes the topological "
"correctness of polygons. GRASS is the ideal tool for this: being a "
"topological GIS, adjacency and correctness are preserved even at very "
"high simplification levels. In our case, we have a vector resulting from "
"a raster, thus showing a \"saw\" pattern at borders. Applying a "
"simplification results in straight lines:"
