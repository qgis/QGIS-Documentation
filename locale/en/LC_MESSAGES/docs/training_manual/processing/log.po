"All the analysis performed with the processing framework is logged in "
"QGIS logging system. This allows you to know more about what has been "
"done with the processing tools, to solve problems when they happen, and "
"also to re--run previous operations, since the logging system also "
"implements some interactivity."

"To open the log, click on the balloon at the bottom right, on the QGIS "
"status bar. Some algorithms might leave here information about their "
"execution. For instance, those algorithms that call an external "
"application usually log the console output of that application to this "
"entry. If you have a look at it, you will see that the output of the SAGA"
" algorithm that we just run (and that fails to execute because input data"
" was not correct) is stored here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is helpful to understand what is going on. Advanced users will be "
"able to analyze that output to find out why the algorithm failed. If you "
"are not an advanced user, this will be useful for others to help you "
"diagnose the problem you are having, which might be a problem in the "
"installation of the external software or an issue with the data you "
"provided."

"Even if the algorithm could be executed, some algorithms might leave "
"warnings in case the result might not be right. For instance, when "
"executing an interpolation algorithm with a very small amount of points, "
"the algorithm can run and will produce a result, but it is likely that it"
" will not be correct, since more points should be used. It's a good idea "
"to regularly check for this type of warnings if you are not sure about "
"some aspect of a given algorithm."

"From the :menuselection:`Processing --> History...` menu, you'll find "
"*algorithms* that are executed, regardless of they are executed from the "
"GUI or from the console (which will be explained later in this manual). "
"The execution is stored in this dialog as a console call. That means that"
" everytime you run an algorithm, a console command is added to the log, "
"and you have the full history of your working session. Here is how that "
"history looks like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be very useful when starting working with the console, to learn "
"about the syntax of algorithms. We will use it when we discuss how to run"
" analysis commands from the console."
