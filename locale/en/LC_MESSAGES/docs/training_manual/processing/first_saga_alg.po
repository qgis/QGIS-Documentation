"In this lesson we will see how to use algorithms that depend on a third-"
"party application, particularly SAGA, which is one of the main algorithm "
"providers."

msgid ""
"All the algorithms that we have run so far are part of processing "
"framework. That is, they are *native* algorithms implemented in the "
"plugin and run by QGIS just like the plugin itself is run. However, one "
"of the greatest features of the processing framework is that it can use "
"algorithms from external applications and extend the possibilities of "
"those applications. Such algorithms are wrapped and included in the "
"toolbox, so you can easily use them from QGIS, and use QGIS data to run "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:17
msgid ""
"Some of the algorithms that you see in the simplified view require third "
"party applications to be installed in your system. One algorithm provider"
" of special interest is SAGA (System for Automated Geospatial Analysis). "
"First, we need to configure everything so QGIS can correctly call SAGA. "
"This is not difficult, but it's important to understand how it works. "
"Each external application has its own configuration, and later in this "
"same manual we will talk about some of the other ones, but SAGA is going "
"to be our main backend, so we will discuss it here."

msgid ""
"If you are on Windows, the best way to work with external algorithms is "
"to install QGIS using the standalone installer. It will take care of "
"installing all the needed dependencies, including SAGA, so if you have "
"used it, there is nothing else to do. You can open the settings dialog "
"and go to the *Providers/SAGA* group."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:32

"The SAGA path should already be configured and pointing to the folder "
"where SAGA is installed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:34
msgid ""
"If you have installed QGIS not using the standalone installer, then you "
"must enter the path to your SAGA installation (which you must have "
"installed separately) there. The required version is SAGA 2.1 [this is "
"changing according to the releases of SAGA]."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:38
msgid ""
"In case you are using Linux, you do not have to set the path to your SAGA"
" installation in the processing configuration. Instead, you must install "
"SAGA and make sure that the SAGA folder is in PATH, so it can be called "
"from the console (just open a console and type ``saga_cmd`` to check it)."
" Under Linux, the target version for SAGA is also 2.1, but in some "
"installations (such as the OSGeo Live DVD) you might have just 2.0.8 "
"available. There are some 2.1 packages available, but they are not "
"commonly installed and might have some issues, so if you prefer to use "
"the more common and stable 2.0.8, you can do it by enabling 2.0.8 "
"compatibility in the configuration dialog, under the *SAGA* group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once SAGA is installed, you can launch a SAGA algorithm double clicking "
"on its name, as with any other algorithm. Since we are using the "
"simplified interface, you do not know which algorithms are based on SAGA "
"or in another external application, but if you happen to double--click on"
" one of them and the corresponding application is not installed, you will"
" see something like this."

"In our case, and assuming that SAGA is correctly installed and "
"configured, you should not see this window, and you will get to the "
"parameters dialog instead."

"Let's try with a SAGA--based algorithm, the one called *Split shapes "
"layer randomly*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:65
msgid ""
"Use the points layer in the project corresponding to this lesson as "
"input, and the default parameter values, and you will get something like "
"this (the split is random, so your result might be different)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:71
msgid ""
"The input layer has been split in two layers, each one with the same "
"number of points. This result has been computed by SAGA, and later taken "
"by QGIS and added to the QGIS project."

msgid ""
"If all goes fine, you will not notice any difference between this SAGA--"
"based algorithm and one of the others that we have previously run. "
"However, SAGA might, for some reason, not be able to produce a result and"
" not generate the file that QGIS is expecting. In that case, there will "
"be problems adding the result to the QGIS project, and an error message "
"like this will be shown."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:83
msgid ""
"This kind of problems might happen, even if SAGA (or any other "
"application that we are calling from the processing framework) is "
"correctly installed, and it is important to know how to deal with them. "
"Let's produce one of those error messages."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:92
msgid ""
"We are using  width and height values that is larger than the specified "
"extent, so SAGA cannot produce any output. In other words, the parameter "
"values are wrong, but they are not checked until SAGA gets them and tries"
" to create the graticule. Since it cannot create it, it will not produce "
"the expected layer, and you will see the error message shown above."

msgid ""
"In SAGA >= 2.2.3, the command will adjust automatically wrong input data,"
" so you'll not get an error. To provoke an error, use negative values for"
" division."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/first_saga_alg.rst:101
msgid ""
"Understanding this kind of problems will help you solve them and find an "
"explanation to what is happening. As you can see in the error message, a "
"test is performed to check that the connection with SAGA is working "
"correctly, indicating you that there might be a problem in how the "
"algorithm was executed. This applies not only to SAGA, but also to other "
"external applications as well."
