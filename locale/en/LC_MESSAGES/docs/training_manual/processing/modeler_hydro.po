"The first model that we created in the previous chapter was a very simple"
" one, with just one input and three algorithms. More complex models can "
"be created, with different types of inputs and containing more steps. For"
" this chapter we will work with a model that creates a vector layer with "
"watersheds, based on a DEM and a threshold value. That will be very "
"useful for calculating several vector layers corresponding to different "
"thresholds, without having to repeat each single step each time."

"This lesson does not contain instructions about how to create your model."
" You already know the necessary steps (we saw them in a :ref:`previous "
"lesson <tm_start_modeler>`) and you have already seen the basic ideas "
"about the modeler, so you should try it yourself. Spend a few minutes "
"trying to create your model, and don't worry about making mistakes. "
"Remember: first add the inputs and then add the algorithms that use them "
"to create the workflow."

"This model contains all the steps needed to complete the calculation, but"
" it just has one input: the DEM. That means that the threshold for "
"channel definition uses a fixed value, which makes the model not as "
"useful as it could be. That is not a problem, since we can edit the "
"model, and that is exactly what we will do."
