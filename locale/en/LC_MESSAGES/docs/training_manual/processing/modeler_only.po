"This lesson shows how to use some algorithms that are only available in "

"The goal of this lesson is to use the modeler to create an interpolation "
"algorithm that takes into account the current selection, not just to use "
"only selected features, but to use the extent of that selection to create"
" the interpolated raster layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:8
msgid ""
"The interpolation process involves two steps, as it has been already "
"explained in previous lessons: rasterizing the points layer and fill the "
"no-data values that appear in the rasterized layer. In case the points "
"layer has a selection, only selected points will be used, but if the "
"output extent is set to be automatically adjusted, the full extent of the"
" layer will be used. That is, the extent of the layer is always "
"considered to be the full extent of all features, not the one computed "
"from just the selected ones. We will try to fix that by using some "
"additional tools into our model."

"Open the modeler and start the model by adding the required inputs. In "
"this case we need a vector layer (restricted to points) and an attribute "
"from it, with the values that we will use for rasterizing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:14
msgid ""
"The next step is to compute the extent of the selected features. That's "
"where we can use the model-only tool called *Vector layer bounds*. First,"
" we will have to create a layer that has the extent of those selected "
"features. Then, we can use this tool on that layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:16
msgid ""
"An easy way of creating a layer with the extent of the selected features "
"is to compute a convex hull of the input points layer. It will use only "
"the selected point, so the convex hull will have the same bounding box as"
" the selection. Then we can add the *Vector layer bounds* algorithm, and "
"use the convex hull layer as input. It should look this in the modeler "
"canvas:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:20
msgid ""
"The result from the *Vector layer bounds* is a set of four numeric values"
" and a extent object. We will use both the numeric outputs and the extent"
" for this exercise."

"We can now add the algorithm that rasterizes the vector layer, using the "
"extent from the *Vector layer bounds* algorithm as input."

"Finally, fill the no-data values of the raster layer using the *Close "
"gaps* algorithm."

msgid ""
"The algorithm is now ready to be saved and added to the toolbox. You can "
"run it and it will generate a raster layer from interpolating the "
"selected points in the input layer, and the layer will have the same "
"extent as the selection."

msgid ""
"Here's an improvement to the algorithm. We have used a harcoded value for"
" the cellsize when rasterizing. This value is fine for our test input "
"layer, but might not be for other cases. We could add a new parameter, so"
" the user enters the desired value, but a much better approach would be "
"to have that value automatically computed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:42
msgid ""
"We can use the modeler-only calculator, and compute that value from the "
"extent coordinates. For instance, to create a layer with a fixed width of"
" 100 pixels, we can use the following formula in the calculator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_only.rst:46
msgid ""
"Now we have to edit the rasterize algorithm, so it uses the output of the"
" calculator instead of the hardcoded value."
