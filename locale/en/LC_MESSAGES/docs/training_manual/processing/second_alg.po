"For this lessons we will need a table and a polygons layer. We are going "
"to create a points layer based on coordinates in the table, and then "
"count the number of points in each polygon. If you open the QGIS project "
"corresponding to this lesson, you will find a table with X and Y "
"coordinates, but you will find no polygons layer. Don't worry, we will "
"create it using a processing geoalgorithm."

"The first thing we are going to do is to create a points layer from the "

"*CRS*: Since this algorithm takes no input layers, it cannot assign a CRS"
" to the output layer based on them. Instead, it asks you to manually "
"select the CRS that the coordinates in the table use. Click on the button"
" on the left--hand side to open the QGIS CRS selector, and select "
"EPSG:4326 as the output CRS. We are using this CRS because the "
"coordinates in the table are in that CRS."

"The dialog contains a simple calculator, so you can type expressions such"

"In this case, we want to create a grid that covers the extent of the "
"input points layer, so we should use its coordinates to calculate the "
