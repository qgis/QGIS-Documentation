"A normal session with the processing tools includes more than running a "
"single algorithm. Usually several of them are run to obtain a result, and"
" the outputs of some of those algorithms are used as input for some of "
"the other ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_twi.rst:10
msgid ""
"Using the model designer, that workflow can be put into a model, which "
"will run all the necessary algorithms in a single run, thus simplifying "
"the whole process and automating it."

"To start this lesson, we are going to calculate a parameter named "
"Topographic Wetness Index. The algorithm that computes it is called "
":guilabel:`Topographic wetness index (twi)`."

"As you can see, there are two mandatory inputs: *Slope* and *Catchment "
"area*. There is also an optional input, but we will not be using it, so "
"we can ignore it."

"The data for this lesson contains just a DEM, so we do not have any of "
"the required inputs. However, we know how to calculate both of them from "
"that DEM, since we have already seen the algorithms to compute slope and "
"catchment area. So we can first compute those layers and then use them "
"for the TWI algorithm."

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/modeler_twi.rst:36
msgid ""
"What we will try to do now is to create an algorithm that calculates the "
"TWI from a DEM in just one single step. That will save us work in case we"
" later have to compute a TWI layer from another DEM, since we will need "
"just one single step to do it instead of the three above. All the "
"processes that we need are found in the  toolbox, so what we have to do "
"is to define the workflow to wrap them. This is where the model designer "
"comes in."

"Two things are needed to create a model: setting the inputs that it will "
"need, and defining the algorithm that it contains. Both of them are done "

"Let's start with the inputs. In this case we do not have much to add. We "

"This dialog is very similar to the one that you can find when running the"
" algorithm from the toolbox, but the element that you can use as "
"parameter values are not taken from the current QGIS project, but from "
"the model itself. That means that, in this case, we will not have all the"
" raster layers of our project available for the *Elevation* field, but "
"just the ones defined in our model. Since we have added just one single "
"raster input named ``DEM``, that will be the only raster layer that we "
"will see in the list corresponding to the :guilabel:`Elevation` "
"parameter."

"Output generated by an algorithm are handled a bit differently when the "
"algorithm is used as a part of a model. Instead of selecting the filepath"
" where you want to save each output, you just have to specify if that "
"output is an intermediate layer (and you do not want it to be preserved "
"after the model has been executed), or it is a final one. In this case, "
"all layers produced by this algorithm are intermediate. We will only use "
"one of them (the slope layer), but we do not want to keep it, since we "
"just need it to calculate the TWI layer, which is the final result that "
"we want to obtain."

"When layers are not a final result, you should just leave the "

"There is not much to select in this first dialog, since we do not have "

"The second algorithm we have to add to our model is the catchment area "
"algorithm. We will use the algorithm named *Catchment area (Paralell)*. "
"We will use the DEM layer again as input, and none of the ouputs it "
