"In this lesson we will be performing some calculation with the raster "

"used and how it deals with some particular situations that it might find."
" Understanding that is important to later get the expected results when "
"using the calculator, and also to understand certain techniques that are "
"commonly applied with it."

"Let's now perform another calculation, this time on the *accflow* layer. "
"This layer contains values of accumulated flow, a hydrological parameter."
" It contains those values only within the area of a given watershed, with"

"``a`` refers to the accumulated flow layer (since it is the first one to "

" first part of the formula here is to divide the accumulated flow layer "
"by itself, which will result in a value of 1 inside the basin, and a no--"
"data value outside. Then we multiply by the DEM, to get the elevation "
"value in those cells inside the basin (``DEM * 1 = DEM``) and the no--"

"This technique is used frequently to *mask* values in a raster layer, and"
" is useful whenever you want to perform calculations for a region other "
"that the arbitrary rectangular region that is used by raster layer. For "
"instance, an elevation histogram of a raster layer doesn't have much "
"meaning. If it is instead computed using only values corresponding to a "
"basin (as in he case above), the result that we obtain is a meaningful "
"one that actually gives information about the configuration of the basin."

"There are other interesting things about this algorithm that we have just"
" run, apart from the no--data values and how they are handled. If you "
"have a look at the extents of the layers that we have multiplied (you can"
" do it double--clicking on their names of the layer in the table of "
"contents and looking at their properties), you will see that they are not"
" the same, since the extent covered by the flow accumulation layer is "
"smaller that the extent of the full DEM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/no_data.rst:68
msgid ""
"That means that those layers do not match, and that they cannot be "
"multiplied directly without homogenizing those sizes and extents by "
"resampling one or both layers. However, we did not do anything. QGIS "
"takes care of this situation and automatically resamples input layers "
"when needed. The output extent is the minimum covering extent calculated "
"from the input layers, and the minimum cell size of their cellsizes."

"In this case (and in most cases), this produces the desired results, but "
"you should always be aware of the additional operations that are taking "
"place, since they might affect the result. In cases when this behaviour "
"might not be the desired, manual resampling should be applied in advance."
" In later chapters, we will see more about the behaviour of algorithms "
"when using multiple raster layers."

"The no-data value comes from the 0/0 expression. Since that is an "
"undetermined value, SAGA will add a NaN (Not a Number) value, which is "
