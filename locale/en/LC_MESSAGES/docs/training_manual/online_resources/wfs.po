"A Web Feature Service (WFS) provides its users with GIS data in formats "

"A Web Feature Service returns the layer itself, not just a map rendered "

"change its symbology and run analysis functions on it. However, this is "
"at the cost of much more data being transmitted. This will be especially "
"obvious if the layers you're loading have complicated shapes, a lot of "
"attributes, or many features; or even if you're just loading a lot of "
"layers. WFS layers typically take a very long time to load because of "

"Although it is of possible to query a WFS layer after having loaded it, "

"For example, on the WFS server we're currently using, there is a layer "

":guilabel:`south_poles_wfs` layer (and perhaps also the "
":guilabel:`antarctica_country_border` layer) that's already been loaded."

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wfs.rst:93
msgid ""
"There are two ways to do this. You can load the whole "
":guilabel:`countries ...` layer, and then build a query as usual once "
"it's loaded. However, transmitting the data for all the countries in the "
"world and then only using the data for South Africa seems a bit wasteful "
"of bandwidth. Depending on your connection, this dataset can take several"
" minutes to load."

msgid ""
"It is rare to find a WFS hosting features you need, if your needs are "
"very specific. The reason why Web Feature Services are relatively rare is"
" because of the large amounts of data that must be transmitted to "
"describe a whole feature. It is therefore not very cost-effective to host"
" a WFS rather than a WMS, which sends only images."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wfs.rst:148

"The most common type of WFS you'll encounter will therefore probably be "
"on a local network or even on your own computer, rather than on the "

"WFS layers are preferable over WMS layers if you need direct access to "

"amount of data that needs to be downloaded (which leads to speed problems"
" and also a lack of easily available public WFS servers) it's not always "
"possible to use a WFS instead of a WMS."
