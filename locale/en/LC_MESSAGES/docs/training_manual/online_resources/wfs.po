"A Web Feature Service returns the layer itself, not just a map rendered "
"from it. This gives you direct access to the data, meaning that you can "
"change its symbology and run analysis functions on it. However, this is "
"at the cost of much more data being transmitted. This will be especially "
"obvious if the layers you're loading have complicated shapes, a lot of "
"attributes, or many features; or even if you're just loading a lot of "
"layers. WFS layers typically take a very long time to load because of "

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wfs.rst:83
msgid ""
"Although it is of possible to query a WFS layer after having loaded it, "
"it's often more efficient to query it before you load it. That way, "
"you're only requesting the features you want, meaning that you use far "
"less bandwidth."

"For example, on the WFS server we're currently using, there is a layer "
"called :guilabel:`countries (excluding Antarctica)`. Let's say that we "
"want to know where South Africa is relative to the "
":guilabel:`south_poles_wfs` layer (and perhaps also the "
":guilabel:`antarctica_country_border` layer) that's already been loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wfs.rst:93
msgid ""
"There are two ways to do this. You can load the whole "
":guilabel:`countries ...` layer, and then build a query as usual once "
"it's loaded. However, transmitting the data for all the countries in the "
"world and then only using the data for South Africa seems a bit wasteful "
"of bandwidth. Depending on your connection, this dataset can take several"
" minutes to load."

msgid ""
"It is rare to find a WFS hosting features you need, if your needs are "
"very specific. The reason why Web Feature Services are relatively rare is"
" because of the large amounts of data that must be transmitted to "
"describe a whole feature. It is therefore not very cost-effective to host"
" a WFS rather than a WMS, which sends only images."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/online_resources/wfs.rst:148

"The most common type of WFS you'll encounter will therefore probably be "
