"Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data in the daily use of "
"GIS. The vector model represents the location and shape of geographic "
"features using points, lines and polygons (and for 3D data also surfaces "
"and volumes), while their other properties are included as attributes "
"(often presented as a table in QGIS)."

"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been "
"influenced by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the "
"land use areas look alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at "
"the map, the viewers don't know anything about the roads they are seeing;"
" only that there is a road of a certain shape in a certain area."

"But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on"

"A row is called a **record** and is associated with a **feature** in the "

"**attribute**), and has a name that helps describe it, such as ``name`` "
"or ``id``. Values in the cells are known as **attribute values**. These "
