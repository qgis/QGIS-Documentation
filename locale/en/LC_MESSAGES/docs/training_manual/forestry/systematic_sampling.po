"There are several methods to inventory forests, each of them suiting "
"different purposes and conditions. For example, one very accurate way to "
"inventory a forest (if you consider only tree species) would be to visit "
"the forest and make a list of every tree and their characteristics. As "
"you can imagine this is not commonly applicable except for some small "
"areas or some special situations."

"The most common way to find out about a forest is by sampling it, that "
"is, taking measurements in different locations at the forest and "
"generalizing that information to the whole forest. These measurements are"
" often made in *sample plots* that are smaller forest areas that can be "
"easily measured. The sample plots can be of any size (for ex. 50 m2, 0.5 "
"ha) and form (for ex. circular, rectangular, variable size), and can be "
"located in the forest in different ways (for ex. randomly, "
"systematically, along lines). The size, form and location of the sample "
"plots are usually decided following statistical, economical and practical"
" considerations. If you have no forestry knowledge, you might be "
"interested in reading `this Wikipedia article "
