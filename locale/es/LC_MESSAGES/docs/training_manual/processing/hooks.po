"perform additional operations before and after actual processing."

"Pre- and post-execution hooks are Processing scripts that run before and "
"after actual data processing is performed. This can be used to automate "
"tasks that should be performed whenever an algorithm is executed."

"The syntax of the hooks is identical to the syntax of Processing scripts, "
"see the corresponding `chapter "
"<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing/console.html>`_"
" in the QGIS User Guide for more details."

"In addition to all scripts features, in hooks you can use a special global "
"variable named ``alg``, which represents the algorithm that has just been "
"(or is about to be) executed."

msgid ""
"Here is an example post-execution script. By default, Processing stores "
"analysis results in temporary files. This script will copy outputs to a "
"specific directory, so they won't be deleted after closing QGIS."

"In the first two lines we import the required Python packages: ``os`` --- "
"for path manipulations, e.g. extracting file name, and ``shutil`` --- for "
"various filesystem operations like copying files. In the third line we "
"import Processing outputs. This will be explained in more detail later in "
"this lesson."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:47

"Then we define a ``MY_DIRECTORY`` constant, which is the path to the "
"directory where we want to copy analysis results."

msgid ""
"At the end of the script, we have the main hook code. In the loop we iterate"
" over all algorithm outputs and check if this output is a file-based output "
"and can be copied. If so, we determine top-level directory in which output "
"files are located and then copy all files to our directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To activate this hook we need to open the Processing options, find the entry"
" named *Post-execution script file* in the *General* group, and specify the "
"filename of the hook script there. the specified hook will be executed after"
" each Processing algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:59
msgid ""
"In a similar way, we can implement pre-execution hooks. For example, let's "
"create a hook to check input vectors for geometry errors."

"As in the previous example, first we import required QGIS and Processing "
"packages."

"Then we iterate over all the algorithm parameters and if a ParameterVector "
"parameter is found, we get the corresponding vector layer object from it. We"
" loop over all the features of the layer and check them for geometry errors."
" If at least one feature contains an invalid geometry, we print a warning "
"message."

"To activate this hook we need enter its filename in the *Pre-execution "
"script file* option in the Processing configuration dialog. The hook will be"
" executed before running any Processing algorithm."
