"In 2008 we launched the :ref:`Gentle Introduction to GIS "
"<gentle_introduction_gis>`, a completely free, open content resource for "
"people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon and "
"new terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and has "
"been a phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to us to "
"tell us how they are using the materials to run University Training Courses,"
" teach themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software "
"tutorial, but rather aims to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all"
" examples) for someone learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual "
"which provides a detailed functional overview of the QGIS application. "
"However, it is not structured as a tutorial, but rather as a reference "
"guide. At Linfiniti Consulting CC. we frequently run training courses and "
"have realised that a third resource is needed - one that leads the reader "
"sequentially through learning the key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee "
"format - which prompted us to produce this work."

"This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to run "
"a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured "
"with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has "
"many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text."
