"Print layout is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "

"layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or directly printed on a "
"printer."

"The layout consists of a bunch of classes. They all belong to the core "
"library. QGIS application has a convenient GUI for placement of the "
