"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information"

"figure_landscape_. Point, polyline and polygon features work well for "
"representing some features on this landscape, such as trees, roads and "
"building footprints. Other features on a landscape can be more difficult to "
"represent using vector features. For example the grasslands shown have many "
"variations in colour and density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a"
" single polygon around each grassland area, but a lot of the information "
"about the grassland would be lost in the process of simplifying the features"
" to a single polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature "
"attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very "
"good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) "
"all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "
"variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with "
"that approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create "
"a good vector dataset."
msgstr "Rasterdaten werden in GIS-Anwendungen benutzt um Informationen darzustellen, die kontinuierlich über eine Fläche verlaufen und nicht leicht in Vektor-Features aufgeteilt werden können. Als wir Sie in Vektordaten eingeführt haben zeigten wir Ihnen das Bild figure_landscape_. Punkt-, Polylinien- und Polygonfeatures funktionieren gut um bestimmte Merkmale dieser Landschaft, wie Bäume, Straßen und Gebäudegrundflächen, abzubilden. Andere Merkmale der Landschaft sind hingegen schwieriger mit Vektor-Features zu erfassen. Zum Beispiel hat das Grünland viele Farbvariationen und verschiedene Bedeckungsgrade. Es wäre leicht einzelne Polygone über jede Grünlandfläche zu legen, dabei würden jedoch viele Informationen über das Grünland durch den Prozess der Vereinfachung von Merkmalen zu einem einzelnen Polygon verloren gehen. Dies aufgrund der Tatsache, dass wenn Sie für ein Vektor-Feature Attributwerte festlegen diese das ganze Feature betreffen. Dadurch sind Vektoren nicht gut geeignet um Merkmale zu erfassen, die nicht komplett homogen (völlig gleich) sind. Eine andere Vorgehensweise wäre jede einzelne Variation an Grasfarben und Bedeckungsgraden als separate Polygone zu erfassen."

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "

"Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth's "

"the image, the size of each pixel in the X direction, the size of each pixel"
" in the Y direction, and the amount (if any) by which the image is rotated. "
"With these few pieces of information, the GIS application can ensure that "

"imagery is created when satellites orbiting the earth point special digital "
"cameras towards the earth and then take an image of the area on earth they "
"are passing over. Once the image has been taken it is sent back to earth "
"using radio signals to special receiving stations such as the one shown in "

"sizes of 50 cm x 50 cm are not uncommon. Images with a pixel size covering a"
" small area are called '**high resolution**' images because it is possible "
