"**Spatial analysis** is the process of manipulating spatial information to "
"extract new information and meaning from the original data. Usually spatial "
"analysis is carried out with a Geographic Information System (GIS). A GIS "
"usually provides spatial analysis tools for calculating feature statistics "
"and carrying out geoprocessing activities as data interpolation. In "
"hydrology, users will likely emphasize the importance of terrain analysis "
"and hydrological modelling (modelling the movement of water over and in the "
"earth). In wildlife management, users are interested in analytical functions"
" dealing with wildlife point locations and their relationship to the "
"environment. Each user will have different things they are interested in "
"depending on the kind of work they do."

"Spatial interpolation is the process of using points with known values to "
"estimate values at other unknown points. For example, to make a "
"precipitation (rainfall) map for your country, you will not find enough "
"evenly spread weather stations to cover the entire region. Spatial "
"interpolation can estimate the temperatures at locations without recorded "
"data by using known temperature readings at nearby weather stations (see "
"figure_temperature_map_). This type of interpolated surface is often called "
"a **statistical surface**. Elevation data, precipitation, snow accumulation,"
" water table and population density are other types of data that can be "
"computed using interpolation."

"Because of high cost and limited resources, data collection is usually "

"In order to generate a continuous map, for example, a digital elevation map "
"from elevation points measured with a GPS device, a suitable interpolation "
"method has to be used to optimally estimate the values at those locations "
"where no samples or measurements were taken. The results of the "
"interpolation analysis can then be used for analyses that cover the whole "

"There are many interpolation methods. In this introduction we will present "

"Weighting is assigned to sample points through the use of a weighting "
"coefficient that controls how the weighting influence will drop off as the "
"distance from new point increases. The greater the weighting coefficient, "
"the less the effect points will have if they are far from the unknown point "
"during the interpolation process. As the coefficient increases, the value of"
" the unknown point approaches the value of the nearest observational point."

"It is important to notice that the IDW interpolation method also has some "
"disadvantages: the quality of the interpolation result can decrease, if the "
"distribution of sample data points is uneven. Furthermore, maximum and "
"minimum values in the interpolated surface can only occur at sample data "
"points. This often results in small peaks and pits around the sample data "
"points as shown in figure_idw_interpolation_."

"TIN interpolation is another popular tool in GIS. A common TIN algorithm is "
"called **Delaunay triangulation**. It tries to create a surface formed by "
"triangles of nearest neighbour points. To do this, circumcircles around "
"selected sample points are created and their intersections are connected to "
"a network of non overlapping and as compact as possible triangles (see "
"figure_tin_interpolation_)."

"The main disadvantage of the TIN interpolation is that the surfaces are not "
"smooth and may give a jagged appearance. This is caused by discontinuous "
"slopes at the triangle edges and sample data points. In addition, "
"triangulation is generally not suitable for extrapolation beyond the area "
"with collected sample data points (see figure_tin_result_ )."

"It is important to remember that there is no single interpolation method "
