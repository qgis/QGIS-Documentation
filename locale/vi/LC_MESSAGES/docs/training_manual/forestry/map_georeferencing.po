"A common forestry task would be the update of the information for a forestry"
" area. It is possible that the previous information for that area dates "
"several years back and was collected analogically (that is, in paper) or "
"perhaps it was digitized but all you have left is the paper version of that "
"inventory data."

"Most likely you would like to use that information in your GIS to, for "
"example, compare later with later inventories. This means that you will need"
" to digitize the information at hand using your GIS software. But before you"
" can start the digitizing, there is an important first step to be done, "
"scanning and georeferencing your paper map."

"The first task you will have to do is to scan your map. If your map is too "
"big, then you can scan it in different parts but keep in mind that you will "
"have to repeat preprocessing and georeferencing tasks for each part. So if "
"possible, scan the map in as few parts as possible."

"If you are going to use a different map that the one provided with this "
"manual, use your own scanner to scan the map as an image file, a resolution "
"of 300 DPI will do. If your map has colors, scan the image in color so that "
"you can later use those colors to separate information from your map into "
"different  layers (for ex., forest stands, contour lines, roads...)."
