"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is stored"
" in the history manager. The date and time of the execution are saved, along"
" with the parameters used, making it is easy to track and control all the "
"work that has been developed using the Processing framework, and to "
"reproduce it."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it useful for those "
"learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how it"
" could be called from the command line."

"Apart from browsing the entries in the registry, you can also re-execute "
"processes by simply double-clicking on the entry. The algorithm dialog then "
"opens with parameters already set, and you can change any of them to fit "
"your needs and re-run the algorithm."

"The :guilabel:`History` dialog also provides a convenient way to contribute "
"to the consolidation of the testing infrastructure of QGIS Processing "
"algorithms and scripts. When you right-click on an entry, you can "
":guilabel:`Create Test...` using the concerned algorithm and parameters, "
"following instructions at "
":source:`python/plugins/processing/tests/README.md`."

"The history dialog only contains the execution calls, but not the "
"information produced by the algorithm when executed. That information is "
"written to the QGIS log (:menuselection:`View --> Panels --> Log Messages "

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by using their command-line "
"interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although that "
"console is not shown, usually a full dump of it is written to the log each "
"time you run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the log with that "
"information, you can disable it for each provider in the settings dialog."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "
"data, output comments or additional information to log when they detect "
"potential problems with the data, in order to warn you. Make sure you check "
"those messages in the log if you get unexpected results."
