"A common forestry task would be the update of the information for a forestry"
" area. It is possible that the previous information for that area dates "
"several years back and was collected analogically (that is, in paper) or "
"perhaps it was digitized but all you have left is the paper version of that "
"inventory data."
msgstr "O activitate silvică obișnuită constă în actualizarea informațiilor pentru zonele forestiere. Este posibil ca informațiile anterioare pentru acea zonă să aibă o vechime de mai mulți ani, să fi fost colectate în mod analogic (adică, pe hârtie) sau poate că au fost digitizate, dar tot ce aveți reprezintă versiunea pe hârtie a datelor inventarului respectiv."

"Most likely you would like to use that information in your GIS to, for "
"example, compare later with later inventories. This means that you will need"
" to digitize the information at hand using your GIS software. But before you"
" can start the digitizing, there is an important first step to be done, "
"scanning and georeferencing your paper map."
msgstr "Cel mai probabil, v-ați dori să utilizați aceste informații în GIS, de exemplu, pentru a le compara mai târziu cu inventarele ulterioare. Acest lucru presupune că va trebui să digitizați manual informațiile, cu ajutorul softului GIS. Dar, înainte de a începe digitizarea, trebuie făcuți pași importanți, cum ar fi scanarea și georeferențierea hărții de hârtie."
