"As has been mentioned, the configuration menu gives access to a new dialog "
"where you can configure how algorithms work. Configuration parameters are "
"structured in separate blocks that you can select on the left-hand side of "
"the dialog."

"Along with the aforementioned :guilabel:`Output folder` entry, the "
":guilabel:`General` block contains parameters for setting the default "
"rendering style for output layers (that is, layers generated by using "
"algorithms from any of the framework GUI components). Just create the style "
"you want using QGIS, save it to a file, and then enter the path to that file"
" in the settings so the algorithms can use it. Whenever a layer is loaded by"
" Processing and added to the QGIS canvas, it will be rendered with that "
"style."

"Rendering styles can be configured individually for each algorithm and each "
"one of its outputs. Just right-click on the name of the algorithm in the "
"toolbox and select :guilabel:`Edit rendering styles for outputs`. You will "
"see a dialog like the one shown next."

":guilabel:`Use filename as layer name`. The name of each resulting layer "
"created by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm itself. In some cases, a"
" fixed name might be used, meaning that the same output name will be used, "
"no matter which input layer is used. In other cases, the name might depend "
"on the name of the input layer or some of the parameters used to run the "
"algorithm. If this checkbox is checked, the name will be taken from the "
"output filename instead. Notice that, if the output is saved to a temporary "
"file, the filename of this temporary file is usually a long and meaningless "
"one intended to avoid collision with other already existing filenames."

":guilabel:`Keep dialog open after running algorithm`. Once an algorithm has "
"finished execution and its output layers are loaded into the QGIS project, "
"the algorithm dialog is closed. If you want to keep it open (to run the "
"algorithm again with different parameters, or to better check the output "
"that is written to the log tab), check this option"

":guilabel:`Use only selected features`. If this option is selected, whenever"
" a vector layer is used as input for an algorithm, only its selected "
"features will be used. If the layer has no selected features, all features "
"will be used."

":guilabel:`Pre-execution script file` and :guilabel:`Post-execution script "

"Apart from the :guilabel:`General` block in the settings dialog, you will "
"also find a block for algorithm providers. Each entry in this block contains"
" an :guilabel:`Activate` item that you can use to make algorithms appear or "
"not in the toolbox. Also, some algorithm providers have their own "
"configuration items, which we will explain later when covering particular "
"algorithm providers."
