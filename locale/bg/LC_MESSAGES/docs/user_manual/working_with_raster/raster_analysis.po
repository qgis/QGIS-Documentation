"The **Raster bands** list contains all loaded raster layers that can be "

"In the **Result layer** section, you will need to define an output layer. "
"You can then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input "
"raster layer, or based on X,Y coordinates and on columns and rows, to set "
"the resolution of the output layer. If the input layer has a different "
"resolution, the values will be resampled with the nearest neighbor "
"algorithm."

"The **Operators** section contains all available operators. To add an "

"trigonometric functions (``sin``, ``cos``, ``tan``, ... ) are available. "
"Conditional expressions (``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>=``, ... ) return either 0"
" for false or 1 for true, and therefore can be used with other operators and"
