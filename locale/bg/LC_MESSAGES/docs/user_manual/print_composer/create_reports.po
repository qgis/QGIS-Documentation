"This section will help you set up an automatic report in QGIS. By definition"
" a GIS report is a document containing information organized in a narrative,"
" graphic, maps, or tabular form, prepared on ad hoc, periodic, recurring, "
"regular, or as required basis. Reports may refer to specific periods, "
"events, occurrences, or subjects, locations, and may be communicated or "
"presented in oral or written form. The reports in QGIS will allow the users "
"to output their GIS projects in a simple, quick and structured way."

"QGIS reports can consist of multiple, nested sections. In our new blank "
"report we initially have only the main report section. The only options "
"present for this report section is :guilabel:`Include report header` or "
":guilabel:`Include report footer`. If we enable these options, the header "
"will be included as the very first page (or pages… --- individual parts of "
"reports can be multi-page if desired) in the report, and the footer would be"
" the last page. Let’s go ahead and enable the header, and hit the "

"A few things happen as a result. Firstly, an edit pencil is now shown next "

"indicating that the report section is currently being edited in the "
"designer. We also see a new blank page shown in the designer itself, with "
"the small :guilabel:`Report Header` title. In QGIS reports, every component "
"of the report is made up of individual layouts. They can be created and "
"modified using the exact same tools as are available for standard print "
"layouts – so you can use any desired combination of labels, pictures, maps, "
"tables, etc. Let’s add some items to our report header to demonstrate:"

"There are two options: :guilabel:`Add Static Layout Section` and a "
":guilabel:`Field Group Section`. The :guilabel:`Add Static Layout Section` "
"is a single, static body layout. This can be used to embed static layouts "
"mid-way through a report. Alternatively, a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` "
"repeats its body layout for every feature in a layer. The features are "
"sorted by the selected grouping feature (with an option for "
"ascending/descending sort). If a field group section has child sections "
"(e.g. another field group section with a different field, then only features"
" with unique values for the group feature are iterated over. This allows "
"nested reports with different information."

"For now we’ll add a Field Group to our report. At its most basic level, you "
"can think of a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` as the equivalent of a "
":ref:`print atlas <atlas_generation>`. You select a layer to iterate over, "
"and the report will insert a section for each feature found. Selecting the "
"new :guilabel:`Field Group Section` reveals a number of new related "
"settings:"

"In this case we’ve setup our Field Group so that we iterate over all the "
"states from the :guilabel:`Admin Level 1` layer, using the values from the "
":guilabel:`adm1name` field. The same options for header and footer are "
"present, together with a new option to include a :guilabel:`body` for this "
"section. We’ll do that, and edit the body:"

"We’ve setup this body with a map (set to follow the current report feature –"

"report now, we’d get something like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:158
msgid ""
"First, the report header, then a page for each state, and finally the report"
" footer. So more or less an atlas, but with a header and footer page. Let’s "
"make things more interesting by adding a subsection to our state group. We "
"do this by first selecting the state field group in the organizer, then "
"hitting the |signPlus| :sup:`Field Group Section` button and adding a new "
":guilabel:`Field Group Section`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:169
msgid ""
"When a :guilabel:`Field Group Section` is iterating over its features, it "
"will automatically filter these features to match the feature attributes "
"from its parent groups. In this case, the subsection we added will iterate "
"over a :guilabel:`Populated Places` layer, including a body section for each"
" place encountered. The magic here is that the :guilabel:`Populated Places` "
"layer has an attribute named :guilabel:`adm1name`, tagging each place with "
"the state it’s contained within (if you’re lucky your data will already be "
"structured like this – if not, run the Processing :ref:`Join Attributes by "
"Location <qgisjoinattributesbylocation>` algorithm and create your own "
"field). When we export this report, QGIS will grab the first state from the "
":guilabel:`Admin Level 1` layer, and then iterate over all the "
":guilabel:`Populated Places` with a matching :guilabel:`adm1name` value. "
"Here’s what we get:"

#: ../../docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:187
msgid ""
"Here we created a basic body for the Populated Places group, including a map"
" of the place and a table of some place attributes. So our report is now a "
"report header, a page for each state followed by a page for every populated "
"place within that state, and finally the report footer. If we were to add a "
"header for the Populated Places group, it would be included just before "
"listing the populated places for each state:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:199

"Similarly, a footer for the Populated Places group would be inserted after "

msgid ""
"In addition to nested subsections, subsections in a report can also be "
"included consecutively. If we add a second subsection to the `Admin Level 1 "
"group` for :guilabel:`Airports`, then our report will first list ALL the "
"populated places for each state, followed by all the airports within that "
"state, before proceeding to the next state. In this case our report would be"
" structured like this:"

"Combining nested and consecutive sections, together with section headers and"
