"Draw up a list of features in and around your school that you think would be"
" interesting to capture. For example: the school boundary, the position of "
"fire assembly points, the layout of each class room, and so on. Try to use a"
" mix of different geometry types. Now split your learners into groups and "
"assign each group a few features to capture. Have them symbolise their "
"layers so that they are more meaningful to look at. Combine the layers from "
"all the groups to create a nice map of your school and its surroundings!"

"If you don't have a computer available, you can follow the same process by "
