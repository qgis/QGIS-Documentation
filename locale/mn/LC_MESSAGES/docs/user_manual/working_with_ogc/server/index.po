"implementation that, in addition, implements advanced cartographic features "
"for thematic mapping. QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway "

"(e.g., Apache, Nginx). It has Python plugin support allowing for fast and "
"efficient development and deployment of new features."

"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map rendering. "
"Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform-"
"independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS "
"Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both for the "
"server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."
