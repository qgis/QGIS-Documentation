"To load a project into the current QGIS application you need to create an "

"singleton class, so you must use its :meth:`instance() "
"<qgis.core.QgsProject.instance>` method to do it. You can call its "
":meth:`read() <qgis.core.QgsProject.read>` method, passing the path of the "
"project to be loaded:"
