"The *graphical modeler* allows you to create complex models using a simple "
"and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis operations"
" are not isolated, rather part of a chain of operations. Using the graphical"
" modeler, that chain of operations can be wrapped into a single process, "
"making it convenient to execute later with a different set of inputs. No "
"matter how many steps and different algorithms it involves, a model is "
"executed as a single algorithm, saving time and effort."
