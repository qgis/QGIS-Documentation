"There are four basic elements in the framework GUI, which are used to run "
"algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another will depend "
"on the kind of analysis that is to be performed and the particular "
"characteristics of each user and project. All of them (except for the batch "
"processing interface, which is called from the toolbox or the algorithm "
"execution dialog, as we will see) can be accessed from the "
":menuselection:`Processing` menu item (you will see more entries; the "
