"In this module you will learn about how to use Spatial Databases with QGIS "
"to manage, display and manipulate data in the database as well as performing"
" analysis by querying. We will primarily use PostgreSQL and PostGIS (which "
"were covered in previous sections), but the same concepts are applicable to "
"other spatial database implementations including SpatiaLite."
