"Spatial Databases allow the storage of the geometries of records inside a "
"Database as well as providing functionality for querying and retrieving the "
"records  using these Geometries. In this module we will use PostGIS, an "
"extension to PostgreSQL, to learn how to setup a spatial database, import "
"data into the database and make use of the geographic functions that PostGIS"
" offers."
