"For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a "
"cell phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes "
"need to be synchronized with the master datasource (e.g., a PostGIS "
"database). If several persons are working simultaneously on the same "
"datasets, it is difficult to merge the edits by hand, even if people don’t "
"change the same features."

"The |offlineEditingCopy| :sup:`Offline Editing` Plugin automates the "
"synchronisation by copying the content of a datasource (usually PostGIS or "
"WFS-T) to a SpatiaLite or GeoPackage database and storing the offline edits "
"to dedicated tables. After being connected to the network again, it is "
"possible to apply the offline edits to the master dataset."
