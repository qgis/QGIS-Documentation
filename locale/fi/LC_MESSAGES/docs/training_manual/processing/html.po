"used to produce text outputs and graphs."

"All the outputs we have produced so far were layers (whether raster or "
"vector). However, some algorithms generate outputs in the form of text and "
"graphics. All this outputs are wrapped in HTML files and displayed in the so"
"--called *Results viewer*, which is another element of the processing "
"framework."

"The algorithm is rather simple, and you just have to select the layer to use"
" and one of its field (a numeric one). The output is of type HTML, but the "
"corresponding box works exactly like the one that you can find in the case "
"of a raster or vector output. You can enter a filepath or leave it blank to "
"save to a temporary file. In this case, however, only the ``html`` and "
"``htm`` extensions are allowed, so there is no way of altering the output "
"format by using a different one."

"Run the algorithm selecting the only layer in the project as input, and the "
"*POP2000* field, and a new dialog like the one shown next will appear once "
"the algorithm is executed and the parameters dialog is closed."

"This is the *Results viewer*. It keeps all the HTML result generated during "
"the current session, easily accessible, so you can check them quickly "
"whenever you need it. As it happens with layers, if you have saved the "
"output to a temporary file, it will be deleted once you close QGIS. If you "
"have saved to a non-temporary path, the file will remain, but it will not "
"appear in the *Results viewer* the next time you open QGIS."

"Some algorithms generate text that cannot be divided into other more "
"detailed outputs. That is the case if, for instance, the algorithm captures "
"the text output from an external process. In other cases, the output is "
"presented as text, but internally is divided into several smaller outputs, "
"usually in the form of numeric values. The algorithm that we have just "
"executed is one of them. Each one of those values is handled as a single "
"output, and stored in a variable. This has no importance at all now, but "
"once we move to the graphical modeler, you will see that it will allow us to"
" use those values as numeric inputs for other algorithms."
