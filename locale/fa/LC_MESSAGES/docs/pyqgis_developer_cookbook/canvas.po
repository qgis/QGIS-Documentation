"The Map canvas widget is probably the most important widget within QGIS "
"because it shows the map composed from overlaid map layers and allows "
"interaction with the map and layers. The canvas always shows a part of the "
"map defined by the current canvas extent. The interaction is done through "
"the use of **map tools**: there are tools for panning, zooming, identifying "
"layers, measuring, vector editing and others. Similar to other graphics "
"programs, there is always one tool active and the user can switch between "
"the available tools."

"The map canvas is implemented with the :class:`QgsMapCanvas "
"<qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas>` class in the :mod:`qgis.gui` module. The "
"implementation is based on the Qt Graphics View framework. This framework "
"generally provides a surface and a view where custom graphics items are "
"placed and user can interact with them.  We will assume that you are "
"familiar enough with Qt to understand the concepts of the graphics scene, "
"view and items. If not, please read the `overview of the framework "
"<https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html>`_."

"Whenever the map has been panned, zoomed in/out (or some other action that "
"triggers a refresh), the map is rendered again within the current extent. "
"The layers are rendered to an image (using the :class:`QgsMapRendererJob "
"<qgis.core.QgsMapRendererJob>` class) and that image is displayed on the "
"canvas. The :class:`QgsMapCanvas <qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas>` class also "
"controls refreshing of the rendered map. Besides this item which acts as a "
"background, there may be more **map canvas items**."

"Typical map canvas items are rubber bands (used for measuring, vector "
"editing etc.) or vertex markers. The canvas items are usually used to give "
"visual feedback for map tools, for example, when creating a new polygon, the"
" map tool creates a rubber band canvas item that shows the current shape of "
"the polygon. All map canvas items are subclasses of :class:`QgsMapCanvasItem"
" <qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvasItem>`  which adds some more functionality to the "
"basic ``QGraphicsItem`` objects."

"This produces a standalone window with map canvas. It can be also embedded "

"Designer, place a ``QWidget`` on the form and promote it to a new class: set"
" ``QgsMapCanvas`` as class name and set ``qgis.gui`` as header file. The "
"``pyuic5`` utility will take care of it. This is a very convenient way of "

" construct map canvas and other widgets (as children of a main window or "
