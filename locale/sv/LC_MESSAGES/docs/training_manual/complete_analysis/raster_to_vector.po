"Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to make use of both "
"raster and vector data when solving a GIS problem, as well as using the "
"various analysis methods unique to these two forms of geographic data. This "
"increases the flexibility you have when considering data sources and "
"processing methods for solving a GIS problem."
