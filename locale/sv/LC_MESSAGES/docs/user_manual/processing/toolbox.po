"The :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` is the main element of the processing "
"GUI, and the one that you are more likely to use in your daily work. It "
"shows the list of all available **algorithms** grouped in different blocks "
"called *Providers*, and custom **models** and **scripts** you can add to "
"extend the set of tools. Hence the toolbox is the access point to run them, "
"whether as a single process or as a batch process involving several "
"executions of the same algorithm on different sets of inputs."
