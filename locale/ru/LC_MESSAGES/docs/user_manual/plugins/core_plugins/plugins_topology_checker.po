"Topology describes the relationships between points, lines and polygons that"
" represent the features of a geographic region. With the Topology Checker "
"plugin, you can look over your vector files and check the topology with "
"several topology rules. These rules check with spatial relations whether "
"your features 'Equal', 'Contain', 'Cover', are 'CoveredBy', 'Cross', are "
"'Disjoint', 'Intersect', 'Overlap', 'Touch' or are 'Within' each other. It "
"depends on your individual questions which topology rules you apply to your "
"vector data (e.g., normally you won't accept overshoots in line layers, but "
"if they depict dead-end streets you won't remove them from your vector "
"layer)."

"QGIS has a built-in topological editing feature, which is great for creating"
" new features without errors. But existing data errors and user-induced "
"errors are hard to find. This plugin helps you find such errors through a "
