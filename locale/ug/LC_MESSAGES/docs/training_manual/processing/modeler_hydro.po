"modeler."

"The first model that we created in the previous chapter was a very simple "
"one, with just one input and 3 algorithms. More complex models can be "
"created, with different types of inputs and containing more step. For this "
"chapter we will work with a model that creates a vector layer with "
"watersheds, based on a DEM and a threshold value. That will be very useful "
"for calculating several vector layers corresponding to different thresholds,"
" without having to repeat each single step each time."

"This lesson does not contain instructions about how to create you model. You"
" already know the necessary steps (we saw them in a previous lesson) and you"
" have already seen the basic ideas about the modeler, so you should try it "
"yourself. Spend a few minutes trying to create your model, and don't worry "
"about making mistakes. Remember: first add the inputs and then add the "
"algorithms that use them to create the workflow."

"In case you could not create the full model yourself and you need some extra"
" help, the data folder corresponding to this lesson contains an 'almost' "
"finished version of it. Open the modeler and then open the model file that "
"you will find in the data folder. You should see something like this."

"This model contains all the steps needed to complete the calculation, but it"
" just has one input: the DEM. That means that the threshold for channel "
"definition use a fixed value, which makes the model not as useful as it "
"could be. That is not a problem, since we can edit the model, and that is "
"exactly what we will do."

"First, let's add a numerical input. That will ask the user for a numerical "
"input that we can use when such a value is needed in any of the algorithms "
"included in our model. Click on the *Number* entry in the inputs tree, and "
"you will see the corresponding dialog. Fill it with the values shown next."

"The input that we have just added is not used, so the model hasn't actually "
"changed. We have to link that input to the algorithm that uses it, in this "
"case the *Channel network* one. To edit an algorithm that already exists in "
"the modeler, just click on the pen icon on the corresponding box in the "
"canvas. If you click on the *Channel network* algorithm, you will see "
"something like this."

"The dialog is filled with the current values used by the algorithm. You can "
"see that the threshold parameter has a fixed value of 1,000,000 (this is "
"also the default value of the algorithm, but any other value could be put in"
" there). However, you might notice that the parameter is not entered in a "
"common text box, but in an option menu. If you unfold it, you will see "
"something like this."

"The input that we added is there and we can select it. Whenever an algorithm"
" in a model requires a numerical value, you can hardcode it and directly "
"type it, or you can use any of the available inputs and values (remember "
"that some algorithms generate single numerical values. We will see more "
"about this soon). In the case of a string parameter, you will also see "
"string inputs and you will be able to select one of them or type the desired"
" fixed value."

"The model is now complete. Try to run it using the DEM that we have used in "
"previous lessons, and with different threshold values. Here you have a "

"hydrological analysis lesson."
