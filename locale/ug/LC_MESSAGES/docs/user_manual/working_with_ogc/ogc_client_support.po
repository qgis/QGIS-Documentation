"A WMS server acts upon requests by the client (e.g., QGIS) for a raster map "

"The WMS server then consults its local data sources, rasterizes the map, and"

"WMS is generically a REST (Representational State Transfer) service rather "
"than a full-blown Web service. As such, you can actually take the URLs "
"generated by QGIS and use them in a web browser to retrieve the same images "
"that QGIS uses internally. This can be useful for troubleshooting, as there "

"WMS server capabilities. This is an automatic feature meant to optimize "

"QGIS can also act as a WMTS client. WMTS is an OGC standard for distributing"
" tile sets of geospatial data. This is a faster and more efficient way of "
"distributing data than WMS because with WMTS, the tile sets are pre-"
"generated, and the client only requests the transmission of the tiles, not "
"their production. A WMS request typically involves both the generation and "
"transmission of the data. A well-known example of a non-OGC standard for "
