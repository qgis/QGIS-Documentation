"This guide describes how to use the QGIS processing framework. It assumes no"
" previous knowledge of the Processing framework or any of the applications "
"that it rely on. It assumes basic knowledge of QGIS. The chapters about "
"scripting assume you have some basic knowledge of Python and maybe the QGIS "
"Python API."

"This guide is comprised of a set of small exercises of progressive "
"complexity. If you have never used the processing framework, you should "
"start from the very beginning. If you have some previous experience, feel "
"free to skip lessons. They are more or less independent of each other, and "
"each one introduces some new concept or some new element, as indicated in "
"the chapter title and the short introduction at the beginning of each "
"chapter. That should make it easy to locate lessons dealing with a "
"particular topic."

"the training manual and referenced at section :ref:`data_downloadlink`. The "
"zip file to download contains several folders corresponding to each one of "
"the lessons in this guide. In each of them you will find a QGIS project "
"file. Just open it and you will be ready to start the lesson."
