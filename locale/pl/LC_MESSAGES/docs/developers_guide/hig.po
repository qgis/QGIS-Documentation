"be grouped together and then use group boxes with a label to identify the "
"topic of that group. Avoid using group boxes with only a single widget / "
"item inside."

"Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and "

"Capitalize all words in Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so "
"on), Functions (menu items, buttons), and other selectable items (combobox "
"items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on): Capitalize all words, "
"except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for example, 'with' "
"but 'Without'), conjunctions (for example, and, or, but), and articles (a, "
"an, the). However, always capitalize the first and last word."

"Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon "
"causes visual noise and does not impart additional meaning, so don't use "
"them. An exception to this rule is when you have two labels next to each "
"other e.g.: Label1 Plugin (Path:) Label2 [/path/to/plugins]"

"Separate advanced options from basic ones. Novice users should be able to "
