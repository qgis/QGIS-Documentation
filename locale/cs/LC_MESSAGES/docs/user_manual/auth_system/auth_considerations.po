"Once the master password is entered, the API is open to access "
"authentication configs in the authentication database, similar to how "
"Firefox works. However, in the initial implementation, no wall against "
"PyQGIS access has been defined. This may lead to issues where a user "
"downloads/installs a malicious PyQGIS plugin or standalone app that gains "
"access to authentication credentials."

"The quick solution for initial release of feature is to just not include "
"most PyQGIS bindings for the authentication system."

"Another simple, though not robust, fix is to add a combobox in "
":menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Authentication` (defaults to "
"\"never\"):"

"Such an option's setting would need to be saved in a location non-accessible"
" to Python, e.g. the authentication database, and encrypted with the master "
"password."

"Sandboxing plugins, possibly in their own virtual environments, would reduce"
" 'cross-plugin' hacking of authentication configs from another plugin that "
"is authorized. This might mean limiting cross-plugin communication as well, "
"but maybe only between third-party plugins."

"Another good solution is to issue code-signing certificates to vetted plugin"
" authors. Then validate the plugin's certificate upon loading. If need be "
"the user can also directly set an untrusted policy for the certificate "
"associated with the plugin using existing certificate management dialogs."

"could never be allowed, and only the use of QGIS core widgets, or "
"duplicating authentication system integrations, would allow the plugin to "
"work with resources that have an authentication configuration, while keeping"
" master password and authentication config loading in the realm of the main "
"app."

"The same security concerns apply to C++ plugins, though it will be harder to"

"The confusing `licensing and exporting`_ issues associated with OpenSSL "
"apply. In order for Qt to work with SSL certificates, it needs access to the"
" OpenSSL libraries. Depending upon how Qt was compiled, the default is to "
"dynamically link to the OpenSSL libs at run-time (to avoid the export "
"limitations)."

"QCA follows a similar tactic, whereby linking to QCA incurs no restrictions,"
" because the qca-ossl (OpenSSL) plugin is loaded at run-time. The qca-ossl "
"plugin is directly linked to the OpenSSL libs. Packagers would be the ones "
"needing to ensure any OpenSSL-linking restrictions are met, if they ship the"
" plugin. Maybe.  I don't really know. I'm not a lawyer."
