Reimbursements for Developer Meetings
*************************************

The Quantum GIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically somewhere
in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face time for
developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, putting heads
together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our :doc:`../sponsorship/index`
to facilitate the event, with co-funding from the host who usually
supplies the venue and the infrastructure for hosting the meeting. Individual
developers also co-fund the event by donating their time and in many cases
financially supporting their visit to the meeting directly.

In the past, the policy was that funding will only be directly provided to
'core' committers and community members of the project. However with increased
funding through donations and our sponsorship programme, and a desire to
promote new developers to get involved in the project, this policy has been
updated as described below.

.. note:: The term 'developer' in this document refers to any person who
   contributes time and effort to the advancement of the project (e.g. through
   documentation, infrastructure maintenance, coding, administration etc.)

Policy for disbursement of funds to individual developers
---------------------------------------------------------

* The project steering committee shall provide arbitration for any query,
  complaint or appeal relating to funding requests by individual developers. In
  the event that the PSC is called apon to arbitrate, a resolution shall be
  proposed and the PSC members shall vote using the -1 / 0 / +1 system to
  indicate dissent, indifference and assent respectively. In the event of a
  tie-break, the PSC Chairman shall make the final decision. The devision made
  by the PSC shall be final.
* Individual applications from non-core developers (i.e. those who do not have
  direct commit access to the QGIS repositories) of EUR200 or less may be
  decided on by the nominated PSC member without requiring a full PSC vote. 
* Individual applications from core-developers may be granted based on
  precident directly by the PSC Financial Representative (Paolo Cavallini). In
  the event of any uncertainty on his part, he may bring the matter to the PSC
  for a vote.
* All funding requests should be made **before** the meeting event.
* Funding may be limited due to budgetary constraints, in which case funding
  will be provided on a first-come first-served basis.
* The PSC / PSC Finance Chair may offer to provide partial funding where
  funding resources are limited.
* The PSC Financial Chair shall maintain complete financial records of what 
  disbursements were made and to whom and these should be available on request
  to the PSC.
