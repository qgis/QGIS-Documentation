Development version
----------------------

**Warning**: Development versions from master are provided for some platforms in addition to the released version. *Master* contains unreleased software that is currently being worked on. As such they are unsupported and only provided for testing purposes to early adopters to check if bugs have been resolved and that no new bugs have been introduced. At any given time it may not work, or may do bad things to your data. Use at your own risk. You have been warned!

Windows
........

**OSGeo4W Installer**: The OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects. QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc. The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed packages beforehand. The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations. Steps are:

* Download OSGEO4W Installer
* Start it
* Select **Advanced Install** and then the *qgis-dev* package from the Desktop section. Also other libraries can be selected.

Linux
...............

Ubuntu
+++++++++++++

* On plain ubuntu

Nightly builds of the Master are available from following repository (i386 and amd64):

Precise::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly precise main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly precise main

Quantal::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly quantal main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly quantal main

To add the the qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring, type::

 gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 997D3880
 gpg --export --armor 997D3880 | sudo apt-key add -

* ubuntugis

There are also nightly builds that depend on updated dependencies found in ubuntugis:

Lucid::

 deb     http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly lucid main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly lucid main
 deb     http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu lucid main

Oneiric::

 deb     http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly oneiric main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly oneiric main
 deb     http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu oneiric main

Precise::

 deb     http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly precise main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly precise main
 deb     http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu precise main

To add the the qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring, type::

 gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 997D3880
 gpg --export --armor 997D3880 | sudo apt-key add -

Debian
+++++++++++

Nightly builds of the Master are available from following repository (i386 and amd64):

Squeeze::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly squeeze main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly squeeze main

Wheezy::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly wheezy main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly wheezy main

Unstable::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly sid main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly sid main

Although the nightly builds can be used to test newer versions, they are mainly meant to test, if the newer qgis versions still build fine on the various distributions using the various (older) versions of libraries found there. Therefore it is not intended to build versions that depend on more current libraries. That means if you need current qgis version with more uptodate libraries you will have to build them yourself.

Fedora
+++++++++++

A newer version might be available in the testing repository -- usually around one week::

 yum install --enablerepo=updates-testing qgis qgis-python qgis-grass qgis-mapserver

RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, ...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to try the cutting edge: http://elgis.argeo.org/repos/testing/6/elgis/

They're happy if you provide feedback on their mailing list.

If it does not work for you, you can try to rebuild the Fedora SRPM. The Fedora 15 version of QGIS builds in Mock for EPEL 6. Notice, this package will not support GRASS, because there is no GRASS package in RHEL/EPEL.

argeo.org has a wiki on rebuilding their packages. For a more general quick guide in rebuilding, you can also take a look at http://zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/howto/rebuild_rpms
