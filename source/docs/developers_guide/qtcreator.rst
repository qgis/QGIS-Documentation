 Getting up and running with QtCreator and QGIS
************************************************

QtCreator is a newish IDE from the makers of the Qt library. With QtCreator you
can build any C++ project, but it's really optimised for people working on
Qt(4) based applications (including mobile apps). Everything I describe below
assumes you are running Ubuntu 11.04 'Natty'.


Installing QtCreator
=====================


This part is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install qtcreator qtcreator-doc

After installing you should find it in your gnome menu.


Setting up your project
========================

I'm assuming you have already got a local QGIS clone containing the
source code, and have installed all needed build dependencies etc. There are
detailed instructions for :ref:`git access <git_access>` and `dependency installation
<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.html>`_.

On my system I have checked out the code into ``$HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS`` and the
rest of the article is written assuming that, you should update these paths as
appropriate for your local system.

On launching QtCreator do:

*File* -> *Open File or Project*

Then use the resulting file selection dialog to browse to and open this file:

.. code-block:: bash

  $HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/CMakeLists.txt

.. image:: images/image01.jpeg

Next you will be prompted for a build location. I create a specific build dir
for QtCreator to work in under:

.. code-block:: bash

  $HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master-qtcreator

Its probably a good idea to create separate build directories for different
branches if you can afford the disk space.

.. image:: images/image02.jpeg


Next you will be asked if you have any CMake build options to pass to CMake. We
will tell CMake that we want a debug build by adding this option:

.. code-block:: bash

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

.. image:: images/image03.jpeg


That's the basics of it. When you complete the Wizard, QtCreator will start
scanning the source tree for autocompletion support and do some other
housekeeping stuff in the background. We want to tweak a few things before we
start to build though.


Setting up your build environment
==================================

Click on the 'Projects' icon on the left of the QtCreator window.

.. image:: images/image04.jpeg

Select the build settings tab (normally active by default).

.. image:: images/image05.jpeg

We now want to add a custom process step. Why? Because QGIS can currently only
run from an install directory, not its build directory, so we need to ensure
that it is installed whenever we build it. Under 'Build Steps', click on the
'Add BuildStep' combo button and choose 'Custom Process Step'.

.. image:: images/image06.jpeg

Now we set the following details:

 Enable custom process step: [yes]

 Command: make

 Working directory: $HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master-qtcreator

 Command arguments: install

.. image:: images/image07.jpeg

You are almost ready to build. Just one note: QtCreator will need write
permissions on the install prefix. By default (which I am using here) QGIS is
going to get installed to ``/usr/local/``. For my purposes on my development
machine, I just gave myself write permissions to the /usr/local directory.

To start the build, click that big hammer icon on the bottom left of the
window.

.. image:: images/image08.jpeg


Setting your run environment
=============================

As mentioned above, we cannot run QGIS from directly in the build directly, so
we need to create a custom run target to tell QtCreator to run QGIS from the
install dir (in my case ``/usr/local/``). To do that, return to the projects
configuration screen.

.. image:: images/image04.jpeg

Now select the 'Run Settings' tab

.. image:: images/image09.jpeg

We need to update the default run settings from using the 'qgis' run
configuration to using a custom one.

.. image:: images/image10.jpeg

Do do that, click the 'Add v' combo button next to the Run configuration
combo and choose 'Custom Executable' from the top of the list.

.. image:: images/image11.jpeg

Now in the properties area set the following details:

 Executable: /usr/local/bin/qgis

 Arguments :

 Working directory: $HOME

 Run in terminal: [no]

 Debugger: C++ [yes]

 Qml [no]

Then click the 'Rename' button and give your custom executable a meaningful
name e.g. 'Installed QGIS'

.. image:: images/image12.jpeg

Running and debugging
======================

Now you are ready to run and debug QGIS. To set a break point, simply open a
source file and click in the left column.

.. image:: images/image14.jpeg

Now launch QGIS under the debugger by clicking the icon with a bug on it in the
bottom left of the window.
