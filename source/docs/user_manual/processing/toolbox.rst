.. _`processing.toolbox`:

The toolbox
============

The *Toolbox* is the main element of the processing GUI, and the one that you are
more likely to use in your daily work. It shows the list of all available
algorithms grouped in different blocks, and it is the access point to run them,
whether as a single process or as a batch process involving several executions
of the same algorithm on different sets of inputs.

.. _figure_toolbox_2:

   **Figure Processing 5:**

   Processing Toolbox |win|

The toolbox contains all the available algorithms, divided into so-called "Providers".

Providers can be (de)activated in the settings dialog. 
A label in the bottom part of the toolbox will remind you of that whenever there
are inactive providers. Use the link in the label to open the settings window and 
set up providers. We will discuss the settings dialog later in this manual.

By default only, providers that do not rely on third-party applications (that is, those that
only require QGIS elements to be run) are active. ALgorithms requiring external applications
might need additional configuration. Configuring providers is explained in a later chapter in this manual.

In the upper part of the toolbox, you will find a text box. To reduce the number
of algorithms shown in the toolbox and make it easier to find the one you need,
you can enter any word or phrase on the text box. Notice that, as you type, the
number of algorithms in the toolbox is reduced to just those that contain the
text you have entered in their names.

If there are algorithms that match your search but belong to a provider that is not active,
an additional label will be shown in the lower part of the toolbox.

If you click on the link in that label, the list of algorithms will also include those from
inactive providers, which will be shown in light gray. A link to active each inactive provider
is also shown.

To execute an algorithm, just double-click on its name in the toolbox.

The algorithm dialog
--------------------

Once you double-click on the name of the algorithm that you want to execute, a
dialog similar to that in the figure below is shown (in this case, the dialog corresponds to
the 'Polygon centroids' algorithm).

.. _figure_parameters_dialog:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Processing 8:**

   :align: center

   Parameters Dialog |win|


This dialog is used to set the input values that the algorithm needs to be
executed. It shows a list of input values and configuration parameters to
be set. It of course has a different content, depending on the requirements of
the algorithm to be executed, and is created automatically based on those
requirements. 

Although the number and type of parameters depend on the characteristics of the
algorithm, the structure is similar for all of them. The parameters found in the
table can be of one of the following types.

* A raster layer, to select from a list of all such layers available (currently
  opened) in |qg|. The selector contains as well a button on its right-hand side,
  to let you select filenames that represent layers currently not loaded in |qg|.
* A vector layer, to select from a list of all vector layers available in |qg|.
  Layers not loaded in |qg| can be selected as well, as in the case of raster
  layers, but only if the algorithm does not require a table field selected from
  the attributes table of the layer. In that case, only opened layers can be
  selected, since they need to be open so as to retrieve the list of field names
  available.

  You will see a button by each vector layer selector, as shown in the figure below.

   Vector iterator button |win|

If the algorithm contains several of them, you will be able to toggle just one of them. If the button corresponding to a vector input is toggled, the algorithm will be executed iteratively on each one of its features, instead of just once for the whole layer, producing as many outputs as times the algorithm is executed. This allows for automating the process when all features in a layer have to be processed separately.

* A table, to select from a list of all available in |qg|. Non-spatial
  tables are loaded into |qg| like vector layers, and in fact they are treated as
  such by the program. Currently, the list of available tables that you will see
  when executing an algorithm that needs one of them is restricted to
  tables coming from files in dBase (:file:`.dbf`) or Comma-Separated Values
  (:file:`.csv`) formats.
* An option, to choose from a selection list of possible options.
* A numerical value, to be introduced in a text box. You will find a button by
  its side. Clicking on it, you will see a dialog that allows you to enter a
  mathematical expression, so you can use it as a handy calculator. Some useful
  variables related to data loaded into |qg| can be added to your expression, so
  you can select a value derived from any of these variables, such as the cell size
  of a layer or the northernmost coordinate of another one.

.. _figure_number_selector:

   **Figure Processing 10:**

   Number Selector |win|

* A range, with min and max values to be introduced in two text boxes.
* A text string, to be introduced in a text box.
* A field, to choose from the attributes table of a vector layer or a single
  table selected in another parameter.
* A coordinate reference system. You can type the EPSG code directly in the text
  box, or select it from the CRS selection dialog that appears when you click on
  the button on the right-hand side.
* An extent, to be entered by four numbers representing its ``xmin``, ``xmax``,
  ``ymin``, ``ymax`` limits. Clicking on the button on the right-hand side of the
  value selector, a pop-up menu will appear, giving you two options: to select the
  value from a layer or the current canvas extent, or to define it by dragging
  directly onto the map canvas.

* A list of elements (whether raster layers, vector layers or tables), to select
  from the list of such layers available in |qg|. To make the selection, click on
  the small button on the left side of the corresponding row to see a dialog like
  the following one.

* A small table to be edited by the user. These are used to define parameters like
  lookup tables or convolution kernels, among others.

  Click on the button on the right side to see the table and edit its values.

     Fixed Table |win|

  Depending on the algorithm, the number of rows can be modified or not by using
  the buttons on the right side of the window.

Along with the parameters tab, you will find another tab named 'Log'. Information provided by the algorithm during its execution is written in this tab, and allow you to track the execution and be aware and have more details about the algorithm as it runs. Notice that not all algorithms write information to this tab, and many of them might run silently without producing any output other than the final files.

On the right hand side of the dialog you wil find a short description of the algorithm, which will help you understand its purpose and its basic ideas.
If such a description is not available, the description panel will not be shown.

Some algorithms might have a more detailed help file, which might include description of every parameter it uses, or examples. In that case, you will find a **[Help]** tab in the  parameters dialog.  


A note on projections
.....................

Algorithms that are run from the processing framework --- this is also true of most of the external applications whose algorithms are
exposed through it--- do not perform any reprojection on input layers and
assume that all of them are already in a common coordinate system and ready to
be analyzed. Whenever you use more than one layer as input to an algorithm,
whether vector or raster, it is up to you to make sure that they are all in the
same coordinate system.

Note that, due to |qg|'s on-the-fly reprojecting capabilities, although two layers
might seem to overlap and match, that might not be true if their original
coordinates are used without reprojecting them onto a common coordinate system.
That reprojection should be done manually, and then the resulting files should be used as
input to the algorithm. Also, note that the reprojection process can be performed with
the algorithms that are available in the processing framework itself.

By default, the parameters dialog will show a description of the CRS of each layer along with
its name, making it easy to select layers that share the same CRS to be used as
input layers. If you do not want to see this additional information, you can
disable this functionality in the Processing settings dialog, unchecking the
:guilabel:`Show CRS` option.

If you try to execute an algorithm using as input two or more layers with
unmatching CRSs, a warning dialog will be shown.

You still can execute the algorithm, but be aware that in most cases that will
produce wrong results, such as empty layers due to input layers not overlapping.

Data objects generated by algorithms
---------------------------------------------

Data objects generated by an algorithm can be of any of the following types:

* A raster layer
* A vector layer
* A table
* An HTML file (used for text and graphical outputs)

These are all saved to disk, and the parameters
table will contain a text box corresponding to each one of these outputs, where
you can type the output channel to use for saving it. An output channel contains
the information needed to save the resulting object somewhere. In the most usual
case, you will save it to a file, but in the case of vector layers, and when they are generated by native algorithms (algorithms not using external applications) you can also save to a PostGIS or Spatialite database, or a memory layer.

To select an output channel, just click on the button on the right side of the
text box, and you will see a small context menu with the available options.


In the most usual case, you will select saving to a file. If you select that option, you will be prompted with a save file dialog, where you can select the desired
file path. Supported file extensions are shown in the file format selector of the
dialog, depending on the kind of output and the algorithm.

The format of the output is defined by the filename extension. The supported
formats depend on what is supported by the algorithm itself. To select a format,
just select the corresponding file extension (or add it, if you are directly typing
the file path instead). If the extension of the file path you entered does not
match any of the supported formats, a default extension will be
appended to the file path, and the file format corresponding to that extension will
be used to save the layer or table. Default extensions are :file:`.dbf`` for
tables, :file:`.tif` for raster layers and :file:`.shp` for vector layers. These can be modified in the setting dialog, selecting any other of the formats supported by QGIS.

If you do not enter any filename in the output text box (or select the corresponding option in the context menu), the result will be saved as a temporary file
in the corresponding default file format, and it will be deleted once you exit
|qg| (take care with that, in case you save your project and it contains temporary
layers).

You can set a default folder for output data objects. Go to the settings
dialog (you can open it from the :menuselection:`Processing` menu), and in the
:guilabel:`General` group, you will find a parameter named :guilabel:`Output folder`.
This output folder is used as the default path in case you type just a filename
with no path (i.e., :file:`myfile.shp`) when executing an algorithm.

When running an algorithm that uses a vector layer in iterative mode, the entered
file path is used as the base path for all generated files, which are named using
the base name and appending a number representing the index of the iteration.
The file extension (and format) is used for all such generated files.

Apart from raster layers and tables, algorithms also generate graphics and text
as HTML files. These results are shown at the end of the algorithm execution in
a new dialog. This dialog will keep the results produced by any algorithm during the
current session, and can be shown at any time by selecting
:menuselection:`Processing --> Results viewer` from the |qg| main menu.

Some external applications might have files (with no particular extension
restrictions) as output, but they do not belong to any of the categories above.
Those output files will not be processed by |qg| (opened or included into the
current |qg| project), since most of the time they correspond to file formats or
elements not supported by |qg|. This is, for instance, the case with LAS files
used for LiDAR data. The files get created, but you won't see anything new in
your |qg| working session.

For all the other types of output, you will find a checkbox that you can use
to tell the algorithm whether to load the file once it is generated by the
algorithm or not. By default, all files are opened.

Optional outputs are not supported. That is, all outputs are created. However, you
can uncheck the corresponding checkbox if you are not interested in a given
output, which essentially makes it behave like an optional output (in other words, the
layer is created anyway, but if you leave the text box empty, it will be saved
to a temporary file and deleted once you exit |qg|).

.. _`processing.options`:

Configuring the processing framework
-------------------------------------

As has been mentioned, the configuration menu gives access to a new dialog
where you can configure how algorithms work. Configuration parameters are
structured in separate blocks that you can select on the left-hand side of the
dialog.

Along with the aforementioned :guilabel:`Output folder` entry, the
:guilabel:`General` block contains parameters for setting the default rendering
style for output layers (that is, layers generated by using algorithms from
any of the framework GUI components). Just create the style you want using |qg|, save
it to a file, and then enter the path to that file in the settings so the algorithms
can use it. Whenever a layer is loaded by SEXTANTE and added to the |qg| canvas,
it will be rendered with that style.

Rendering styles can be configured individually for each algorithm and each one
of its outputs. Just right-click on the name of the algorithm in the toolbox and
select :guilabel:`Edit rendering styles`. You will see a dialog like the one shown
next.

.. _figure_rendering_styles:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Processing 16:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing/rendering_styles.png
   :align: center

   Rendering Styles |win|

Select the style file (:file:`.qml`) that you want for each output and press
**[OK]**.

Other configuration parameters in the :guilabel:`General` group are listed below:

* :guilabel:`Use filename as layer name`. The name of each resulting layer created
  by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm itself. In some cases, a fixed
  name might be used, meaning that the same output name will be used, no matter
  which input layer is used. In other cases, the name might depend on the name
  of the input layer or some of the parameters used to run the algorithm. If this
  checkbox is checked, the name will be taken from the output filename instead.
  Notice that, if the output is saved to a temporary file, the filename of this
  temporary file is usually a long and meaningless one intended to avoid collision
  with other already existing filenames.
* :guilabel:`Keep dialog open after running algorithm`. Once an algorithm has finished execution and its output layers are loaded into the QGIS project, the algorithm dialog is closed. If you want to keep it open (to run the algorithm again with different parameters, or to better check the output that is written to the log tab), check this option
* :guilabel:`Use only selected features`. If this option is selected, whenever a
  vector layer is used as input for an algorithm, only its selected features will
  be used. If the layer has no selected features, all features will be used.
* :guilabel:`Pre-execution script file` and :guilabel:`Post-execution script file`.
  These parameters refer to scripts written using the processing scripting
  functionality, and are explained in the section covering scripting and the
  console.

Apart from the :guilabel:`General` block in the settings dialog, you will also
find a block for algorithm providers. Each entry in this block contains an :guilabel:`Activate` item
that you can use to make algorithms appear or not in the toolbox. Also, some
algorithm providers have their own configuration items, which we will explain later
when covering particular algorithm providers.
