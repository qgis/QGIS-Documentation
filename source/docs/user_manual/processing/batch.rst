Introduction
------------

All algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. That
is, they can be executed using not just a single set of inputs, but several of them,
executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is useful when processing
large amounts of data, since it is not necessary to launch the algorithm many
times from the toolbox. testing changes.

To execute an algorithm as a batch process, right-click on its name in the toolbox
and select the :guilabel:`Execute as batch process` option in the pop-up menu
that will appear.

   Batch Processing from right-click

If you have the execution dialog of the algorithm open, you can also start the
batch processing interface from there, clicking on the :guilabel:`Run as batch
process...` button.

The parameters table
--------------------

Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an
algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not just
a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for each time
the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a table like the
one shown next.

   Batch Processing

Each line of this table represents a single execution of the algorithm, and each
cell contains the value of one of the parameters. It is similar to the parameters
dialog that you see when executing an algorithm from the toolbox, but with a
different arrangement.

By default, the table contains just two rows. You can add or remove rows using
the buttons on the lower part of the window.

Once the size of the table has been set, it has to be filled with the desired
values.

Filling the parameters table
----------------------------

For most parameters, setting the value is trivial. Just type the value or select
it from the list of available options, depending on the parameter type.

Filenames for input data objects are introduced directly typing or, more
conveniently, clicking on the |browseButton| button on the right hand of the cell,
which will show a context menu with two option: one for selecting from the layers
currently opened and another to select from the filesystem. This second option,
when selected, shows a typical file chooser dialog. Multiple files can be
selected at once.
If the input parameter represents a single data object and several files are
selected, each one of them will be put in a separate row, adding new ones if
needed. If the parameter represents a multiple input, all the selected files
will be added to a single cell, separated by semicolons (``;``).

Layer identifiers can be directly typed in the parameter text box. You can enter
the full path to a file or the name of a layer that is currently loaded in the
current QGIS project. The name of the layer will be automatically resolved to
its source path. Notice that, if several layers have the same name, this might
cause unexpected results due to ambiguity.

Output data objects are always saved to a file and, unlike when executing an
algorithm from the toolbox, saving to a temporary file or database is not permitted. You can
type the name directly or use the file chooser dialog that appears when clicking
on the accompanying button.

Once you select the file, a new dialog is shown to allow for autocompletion of
other cells in the same column (same parameter).

If the default value ('Do not autocomplete') is selected, it will just put
the selected filename in the selected cell from the parameters table. If any of
the other options is selected, all the cells below the selected one will be
automatically filled based on a defined criteria. This way, it is much easier to
fill the table, and the batch process can be defined with less effort.

Automatic filling can be done by simply adding correlative numbers to the selected
file path, or by appending the value of another field at the same row. This is
particularly useful for naming output data objects according to input ones.

Executing the batch process
---------------------------

To execute the batch process once you have introduced all the necessary values,
just click on **[OK]**. Progress of the global batch task will be shown in the
progress bar in the lower part of the dialog.


.. Substitutions definitions - AVOID EDITING PAST THIS LINE
   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
   source folder.
