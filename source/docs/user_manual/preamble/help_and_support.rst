Mailing lists
=============

QGIS is under active development and as such it won't always work like
you expect it to. The preferred way to get help is by joining the qgis-users
mailing list. Your questions will reach a broader audience and answers will
benefit others.

qgis-users
----------

This mailing list is used for discussion of QGIS in general, as well as
specific questions regarding its installation and use. You can subscribe
to the qgis-users mailing list by visiting the following URL:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user

fossgis-talk-liste
------------------

For the german speaking audience the german FOSSGIS e.V. provides the
fossgis-talk-liste mailing list. This mailing list is used for discussion
of open source GIS in general including QGIS. You can subscribe to the
fossgis-talk-liste mailing list by visiting the following URL:
https://lists.fossgis.de/mailman/listinfo/fossgis-talk-liste

qgis-developer
--------------

If you are a developer facing problems of a more technical nature, you
may want to join the qgis-developer mailing list here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-developer

qgis-commit
-----------

Each time a commit is made to the QGIS code repository an email is posted
to this list. If you want to be up to date with every change to the current
code base, you can subscribe to this list at:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-commit

qgis-trac
---------

This list provides email notification related to project management,
including bug reports, tasks, and feature requests. You can subscribe

qgis-community-team
-------------------

This list deals with topics like documentation, context help, user-guide,
online experience including web sites, blog, mailing lists, forums, and
translation efforts. If you like to work on the user-guide as well, this
list is a good starting point to ask your questions. You can subscribe
to this list at: http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team

qgis-release-team
-----------------

This list deals with topics like the release process, packaging binaries
for various OS and announcing new releases to the world at large. You can
subscribe to this list at:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-release-team

qgis-tr
-------

This list deals with the translation efforts. If you like to work on the
translation of the manuals or the graphical user interface (GUI), this
list is a good starting point to ask your questions. You can subscribe
to this list at: http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-tr

qgis-edu
--------

This list deals with QGIS education efforts. If you like to work on QGIS
education materials, this list is a good starting point to ask your
questions. You can subscribe to this list at:

qgis-psc
--------

This list is used to discuss Steering Committee issues related to overall
management and direction of |qg|. You can subscribe to this list

You are welcome to subscribe to any of the lists. Please remember to
contribute to the list by answering questions and sharing your experiences.
Note that the qgis-commit and qgis-trac are designed for notification only
and not meant for user postings.

IRC
===

We also maintain a presence on IRC - visit us by joining the #qgis channel
on irc.freenode.net. Please wait around for a response to your question
as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while
for them to notice your question. Commercial support for QGIS is also
available. Check the website http://qgis.org/en/commercial-support.html
for more information.

If you missed a discussion on IRC, not a problem! We log all discussion
so you can easily catch up. Just go to http://logs.qgis.org and read the
IRC-logs.

BugTracker
==========

While the qgis-users mailing list is useful for general 'how do I do XYZ
in QGIS' type questions, you may wish to notify us about bugs in QGIS.
You can submit bug reports using the QGIS bug tracker at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues. When creating a new
ticket for a bug, please provide an email address where we can request
additional information.

Please bear in mind that your bug may not always enjoy the priority you
might hope for (depending on its severity). Some bugs may require significant
developer effort to remedy and the manpower is not always available for
this.

Feature requests can be submitted as well using the same ticket system
as for bugs. Please make sure to select the type ``Feature``.

If you have found a bug and fixed it yourself you can submit this patch
also. Again, the lovely redmine ticketsystem at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues has this type as well.
Check ``Patch supplied`` checkbox and attach your patch before submitting
bug. Someone of the developers will review it and apply it to QGIS. Please
don't be alarmed if your patch is not applied straight away --- developers
may be tied up with other committments.

Blog
====

The QGIS-community also runs a weblog at http://www.qgis.org/planet
which has some interesting articles for users and developers as well provided
by other blogs in the community. You are invited to contribute your own QGIS
blog!

Plugins
=======

The website http://plugins.qgis.org provides the official QGIS plugins web portal. 
Here you find a list of all stable and experimental QGIS plugins available via 
the 'Official QGIS Plugin Repository'. 

Wiki
====

Lastly, we maintain a WIKI web site at http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki
where you can find a variety of useful information relating to QGIS
development, release plans, links to download sites, message
translation-hints and so on. Check it out, there are some goodies inside!
