Features
*********

|qg| offers many common GIS functionalities provided by core features and
plugins. As a short summary they are presented in six categories to gain a
first insight.

View data
---------

You can view and overlay vector and raster data in different formats and
projections without conversion to an internal or common format. Supported
formats include:

*  Spatially-enabled tables and views using PostGIS, SpatiaLite and MSSQL Spatial, vector
   formats supported by the installed OGR library, including ESRI shapefiles,
   MapInfo, SDTS, GML and many more, see section :ref:`label_workingvector`.
*  Raster and imagery formats supported by the installed GDAL (Geospatial
   Data Abstraction Library) library, such as GeoTiff, Erdas Img., ArcInfo Ascii
   Grid, JPEG, PNG and many more, see section :ref:`working_with_raster`.
*  GRASS raster and vector data from GRASS databases (location/mapset),
   see section :ref:`sec_grass`.
*  Online spatial data served as OGC-compliant Web Map Service (WMS) or
   Web Feature Service (WFS), see section :ref:`working_with_ogc`.
*  OpenStreetMap data, see section :ref:`plugins_osm`.

Explore data and compose maps
-----------------------------

You can compose maps and interactively explore spatial data with a friendly
GUI. The many helpful tools available in the GUI include:

*  QGIS browser
*  On the fly projection
*  Map composer
*  Overview panel
*  Spatial bookmarks
*  Identify/select features
*  Edit/view/search attributes
*  Feature labeling
*  Change vector and raster symbology
*  Add a graticule layer - now via fTools plugin and as decoration
*  Decorate your map with a north arrow scale bar and copyright label
*  Save and restore projects

Create, edit, manage and export data
------------------------------------

You can create, edit, manage and export vector maps in several formats. Raster
data have to be imported into GRASS to be able to edit and export them into
other formats. QGIS offers the following:

*  Digitizing tools for OGR supported formats and GRASS vector layer
*  Create and edit shapefiles and GRASS vector layers
*  Geocode images with the Georeferencer plugin
*  GPS tools to import and export GPX format, and convert other GPS
   formats to GPX or down/upload directly to a GPS unit (on Linux, usb: has been
   addedto list of GPS devices)
*  Visualize and edit OpenStreetMap data
*  Create PostGIS layers from shapefiles with the SPIT plugin
*  Improved handling of PostGIS tables
*  Manage vector attribute tables with the new attribute table (see section
   :ref:`sec_attribute_table`) or Table Manager plugin
*  Save screenshots as georeferenced images

Analyse data
------------

You can perform spatial data analysis on PostgreSQL/PostGIS and other OGR
supported formats using the fTools Python plugin. QGIS currently offers
vector analysis, sampling, geoprocessing, geometry and database management
tools. You can also use the integrated GRASS tools, which
include the complete GRASS functionality of more than 400 modules (See Section
:ref:`sec_grass`). Or you work with SEXTANTE, which provides powerful geospatial
analysis framework to call native and third party algorithms from QGIS, such as
GDAL, SAGA, GRASS, fTools and more (see section :ref:`label_sextante`).

Publish maps on the Internet
----------------------------

QGIS can be used to export data to a mapfile and to publish them on the
Internet using a webserver with MapServer installed. QGIS can also
be used as a WMS, WMS-C or WFS and WFS-T client, and as WMS or WFS server
(see section :ref:`sec_ogc`).

Extend QGIS functionality through plugins
-----------------------------------------

QGIS can be adapted to your special needs with the extensible
plugin architecture. QGIS provides libraries that can be used to create
plugins.  You can even create new applications with C++ or Python!

External Python Plugins
........................

QGIS offers a growing number of external python plugins that are provided by
the community. These plugins reside in the official plugins repository, and
can be easily installed using the Python Plugin Installer (See Section
:ref:`load_external_plugin`).

What's new in the version |CURRENT|
-----------------------------------

Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As such
it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS 1.0.x
and QGIS 1.7.0. We recommend that you use this version over previous releases.

This release includes hundreds of bug fixes and many new features and enhancements
that will be described in this manual.

**QGIS Browser**

For the stand alone app and panel in QGIS there is now a second browser available. You can
add selected layers and filter files now.

**DB Manager**

The DB manager was extended with new functions. You can easily import and export files and layers
into your database now.

You can drag layers from the
QGIS Browser into DB Manager and it will import your layer into your spatial
database. Drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will get
imported. You can use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial
database and then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to
QGIS as a query layer. You can also create, edit, delete, and empty tables, and
move them to another schema.

**Terrain Analysis Plugin**

A new core plugin was added for doing terrain analysis (slope, aspect, hillshade,
relief and ruggedness index).

**New symbol layer types**

* Line Pattern Fill
* Point Pattern Fill
* Ellipse renderer (render ellipse and also rectangles, triangles, crosses)

**New plugin repository**

Note that the old repository is now no longer supported by default; plugin authors
are kindly requested to move their plugins to the new repository. Get the QGIS
Plugins list at http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/.
