Welcome to the wonderful world of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)!

|qg| is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was born
in May of 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in June of
the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software (which is
traditionally expensive proprietary software) a viable prospect for anyone
with basic access to a personal computer. |qg| currently runs on most Unix
platforms, Windows, and OS X. |qg| is developed using the Qt toolkit
(http://qt.digia.com) and C++.  This means that |qg| feels snappy and has a
pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI).

|qg| aims to be a user-friendly GIS, providing common functions and
features.  The initial goal of the project was to provide a GIS data
viewer. |qg| has reached the point in its evolution where it is being used
by many for their daily GIS data-viewing needs. |qg| supports a number of
raster and vector data formats, with new format support easily added using
the plugin architecture.

|qg| is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Developing
|qg| under this license means that you can inspect and modify the source
code, and guarantees that you, our happy user, will always have access to a
GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely modified. You should
have received a full copy of the license with your copy of |qg|, and you
also can find it in Appendix :ref:`gpl_appendix`.
