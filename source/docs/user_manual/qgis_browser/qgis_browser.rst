QGIS Browser
************

The QGIS Browser is a panel in QGIS that lets you easily navigate in your
database. You can have access to common vector files (e.g. ESRI shapefile or
MapInfo files), databases (e.g.PostGIS, Oracle, Spatialite or MSSQL Spatial) 
and WMS/WFS connections. You can also view your GRASS data (to get the data 
into QGIS see :ref:`sec_grass`).

   QGIS browser as a standalone application to view metadata, preview and attributes |nix|

Use QGIS Browser to preview your data. The drag and drop function makes it easy
to get your data into the Map view and the Map legend.

.. here we can mention the possibility to drag&drop data into the db-manager!

#. Activate QGIS Browser: Right-click on the tool bar and click |checkbox|:guilabel:`Browser`.
#. Drag the panel into the legend window.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Browser` tab.
#. Browse in your database and choose the shapefile folder from qgis_sample_data.
#. Press the :kbd:`Shift` key and click on airports.shp and alaska.shp .  
#. Press the left mouse button then drag and drop the files into the map canvas.
#. Right-click on a layer and choose :guilabel:`Set project CRS from layer`.
   For more information see :ref:`label_projections`.
#. Click on |mActionZoomFullExtent| :guilabel:`Zoom Full` to make the layers
   visible.

From |qg| 2.0 there is a second browser available. Additional functions like 
the |mActionAdd|:sup:`Add Selected Layers` and the |mActionFilter|:sup:`Filter files` 
function were inserted. 

#. Activate a second QGIS Browser: Right-click on the toolbar and click |checkbox|:guilabel:`Browser (2)` .
#. Drag the panel into the legend window.
#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Browser (2)` tab and browse for a shapefile in your file system. 
#. Select a file with the left mouse button. Now you can use the |mActionAdd|:sup:`Add Selected Layers` icon. Use the icon to be able to work with  a file in QGIS without much effort.

QGIS automatically looks for the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and zooms to the layer extent if you work in a blank QGIS project. If there are already files in your project the file just will be added and in case it has the same extent and CRS it will be visualized. If the file has got another CRS and layer extent you must first right-click on the layer and choose :guilabel:`Set Project CRS from Layer`. Then choose :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer Extent`.
To work with the |mActionFilter|:sup:`Filter files` function ...

It's also possible to run QGIS Browser as a standalone application.

**Start qgis browser**

* |nix| Type in "qbrowser" at a command prompt.
* |win| Start QGIS browser using the Start menu or desktop shortcut, or 
  double click on a QGIS project file.
* |osx| QGIS browser is available from your your Applications folder.

In figure_browser_standalone_metadata_ you can see the enhanced functionality
of Qgis browser. The :guilabel:`Param` tab provides the details of your
connection based datasets like PostGIS or MSSQL Spatial. The :guilabel:`Metadata`
tab contains general information about the file (see :ref:`vectormetadatamenu`).
With the :guilabel:`Preview` tab you can have a look at your files without
importing them into your QGIS project. It's also possible to preview the 
attributes of your files in the :guilabel:`Attributes` tab.
