Expressions
============

   :local:

The **Expressions** feature is available from many parts in QGIS. It can be 
accessed using the |mIconExpressionSelect| :sup:`Select by expression`, the 
|mActionCalculateField| :sup:`Field calculator` or the 
|mIconDataDefine| :sup:`Data defined override` tool. 
It offers a powerful way to manipulate attribute value or variables in
order to dynamically change the geometry style, the content or position
of the label, the value for diagram, the height of a composer item, 
select some feature, create virtual column ...

The **Expressions** feature offers access to the:

- :guilabel:`Expression` tab which lists functions to use 
- :guilabel:`Function Editor` tab which helps to create custom functions 
  to use in the expressions.

   The Expression tab |nix|

The **Expression** tab contains functions as well as layer's fields and values.
It contains widgets to:

- type expressions using functions and/or fields. A preview of the expression's 
  result is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.
- select the appropriate function among a list. A search box is available to 
  filter the list and quickly find a particular function or field. 
  Double-clicking on the item's name adds it to the expression being written. 
- display help for each function selected. When a field is selected, this widget 
  shows a sample of its values. Double-clicking a value adds it to the expression.


To help to quickly find a function, they are organized in groups.
In :guilabel:`Operators`, you find mathematical operators.
Look in :guilabel:`Math` for mathematical functions. 
The :guilabel:`Conversions` group contains functions that convert one 
data type to another.
The :guilabel:`String` group provides functions for data strings, 
such as :guilabel:`Date and Time` handles date and time data. 
In the :guilabel:`Geometry` group, you find functions for geometry objects. 
With :guilabel:`Record` group functions, you can add a numeration to your data set 
while :guilabel:`Fields and Values` group helps view all attributes of the attribute table.
The :guilabel:`Customs` group lists the functions created or imported by the user. 
There are many other groups, listed below.

            times with remainder 1)
 a ^ b      a power b (for example, 2^2=4 or 2^3=8)
 a = b      a and b are equal

                               care to not be confused with simple 
                               quote, see below

Recent Functions
-----------------

This group contains recently used functions. Any expression used in the 
Expression dialog is added to the list, sorted from the more recent to 
the less one. This helps to quickly retrieve any previous expression.


Variables Functions
--------------------

This group contains dynamic variables related to the application, the project 
file and other settings. 
It means that some functions may not be available according to the context:

- from the |mIconExpressionSelect| :sup:`Select by expression` dialog
- from the |mActionCalculateField| :sup:`Field calculator` dialog
- from the layer properties dialog
- from the print composer
 
To use these functions in an expression, they should be preceded by @ character 
(e.g, @row_number). Are concerned:

.. _function_editor:

Function Editor
****************

With the Function Editor, you are able to define your own Python custom 
functions in a comfortable way.

.. _figure_expression_2:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Expression 2:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_vector/function_editor.png
   :align: center

   The Function Editor tab |nix|

The function editor will create new Python files in :file:`.qgis2\\python\\expressions` 
folder and will auto load all functions defined when starting QGIS. Be aware 
that new functions are only saved in the :file:`expressions` folder and not in 
the project file. If you have a project that uses one of your custom functions 
you will need to also share the .py file in the expressions folder. 

Here's a short example on how to create your own functions:

.. code-block:: python

   @qgsfunction(args="auto", group='Custom')
   def myfunc(value1, value2, feature, parent):
       pass

The short example creates a function 'myfunc' that will give you a function 
with two values.
When using the args='auto' function argument the number of function
arguments required will be calculated by the number of arguments the
function has been defined with in Python (minus 2 - feature, and parent).

This function then can be used with the following expression:

.. code-block:: python

   myfunc('test1', 'test2')

Your function will be implemented in the :guilabel:`Custom` functions group of 
the :guilabel:`Expression` tab after using the :guilabel:`Run Script` button.

Further information about creating Python code can be found on 
http://www.qgis.org/html/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html.

The function editor is not only limited to working with the field calculator, 
it can be found whenever you work with expressions.
