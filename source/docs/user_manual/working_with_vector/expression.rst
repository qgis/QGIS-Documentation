The **Expressions** feature is available from many parts in QGIS. It can be
accessed using the |expressionSelect| :sup:`Select by expression`, the
|calculateField| :sup:`Field calculator` or the
|dataDefined| :sup:`Data defined override` tool.
Expressions are build from the layer data and prebuild or user defined functions. 
It offers a powerful way to manipulate attribute value or variables in
order to dynamically change the geometry style, the content or position
of the label, the value for diagram, the height of a composer item,
select some feature, create virtual column ...

**Some examples:**

* From Field Calculator, update the column pop_density from existing total_pop and area_km2 columns::

    "total_pop" / "area_km2"

* Update the column density_level with categories according to the pop_density values::

    CASE WHEN "pop_dens" < 50 THEN 'Low population density' 
		  WHEN "pop_dens" >= 50 and "pop_dens" < 150 THEN 'Medium population density'
		  WHEN "pop_dens" >= 150 THEN 'High population density'
    END


When in Rule-based style, expressions can be used to fine tune under which conditions a 
style is to be applied. This is especially useful to style layers according to two or more criteria.

* Apply a given style to all the features representing areas of “High population density” and  
whose average house price is higher than 10000€ per square metre::

    "pop_dens" = 'High population density' and "price_m2" > 10000
    
    
Likewise, the previous expression could also be used to define which features should be labeled.

The **Expressions** feature offers access to the:

- :guilabel:`Expression` tab which lists functions to use
- :guilabel:`Function Editor` tab which helps to create custom functions
  to use in the expressions.

   The Expression tab

The **Expression** tab contains functions as well as layer's fields and values.
It contains widgets to:

- type expressions using functions and/or fields. A preview of the expression's
  result is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.
- select the appropriate function among a list. A search box is available to
  filter the list and quickly find a particular function or field.
  Double-clicking on the item's name adds it to the expression being written.
- display help for each function selected. When a field is selected, this widget
  shows a sample of its values. Double-clicking a value adds it to the expression.


To help to quickly find a function, they are organized in groups.
In :guilabel:`Operators`, you find mathematical operators.
Look in :guilabel:`Math` for mathematical functions.
The :guilabel:`Conversions` group contains functions that convert one
data type to another.
The :guilabel:`String` group provides functions for data strings,
such as :guilabel:`Date and Time` handles date and time data.
In the :guilabel:`Geometry` group, you find functions for geometry objects.
With :guilabel:`Record` group functions, you can add a numeration to your data set
while :guilabel:`Fields and Values` group helps view all attributes of the attribute table.
The :guilabel:`Customs` group lists the functions created or imported by the user.
There are many other groups, listed below.

appropriate field and choose between :guilabel:`Load top 10 unique values`
and :guilabel:`Load all unique values`. On the right side, the **Field Values**
list opens with the unique values. At the top of the list, a search box helps
filtering the values. To add a value to the expression you are writing,
double click its name in the list.

Sample values can also be accessed via right-click.
Select the field name from the list, then right-click to access a context menu
with options to load sample values from the selected field.

Fields name should be double-quoted in the expression.
Values or string should be simple-quoted.

.. _function_editor:

Function Editor
===============

With the Function Editor, you are able to define your own Python custom
functions in a comfortable way.

.. _figure_expression_2:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Expression 2:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_vector/function_editor.png
   :align: center

   The Function Editor tab

The function editor will create new Python files in :file:`.qgis2\\python\\expressions`
folder and will auto load all functions defined when starting QGIS. Be aware
that new functions are only saved in the :file:`expressions` folder and not in
the project file. If you have a project that uses one of your custom functions
you will need to also share the .py file in the expressions folder.

Here's a short example on how to create your own functions:

.. code-block:: python

   @qgsfunction(args="auto", group='Custom')
   def myfunc(value1, value2, feature, parent):
       pass

The short example creates a function 'myfunc' that will give you a function
with two values.
When using the args='auto' function argument the number of function
arguments required will be calculated by the number of arguments the
function has been defined with in Python (minus 2 - feature, and parent).

This function then can be used with the following expression:

.. code-block:: python

   myfunc('test1', 'test2')

Your function will be implemented in the :guilabel:`Custom` functions group of
the :guilabel:`Expression` tab after using the :guilabel:`Run Script` button.

Further information about creating Python code can be found in the
:ref:`PyQGIS-Developer-Cookbook`.

The function editor is not only limited to working with the field calculator,
it can be found whenever you work with expressions.
