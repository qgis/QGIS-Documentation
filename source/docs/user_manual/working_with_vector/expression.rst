Based on layer data and prebuilt or user defined functions, **Expressions**
offer a powerful way to manipulate attribute value, geometry and variables
in order to dynamically change the geometry style, the content or position
of the label, the value for diagram, the height of a layout item,
select some features, create virtual field ...

.. _expression_builder:

The Expression string builder
=============================

Main dialog to build expressions, the :guilabel:`Expression string builder`
is available from many parts in QGIS and, can particularly be accessed when:

* clicking the |expression| button;
* :ref:`selecting features <sec_selection>` with the |expressionSelect|
  :sup:`Select By Expression...` tool;
* :ref:`editing attributes <calculate_fields_values>` with e.g. the
  |calculateField| :sup:`Field calculator` tool;
* manipulating symbology, label or layout item parameters with the |dataDefined|
  :sup:`Data defined override` tool (see :ref:`data_defined`);
* building a :ref:`geometry generator <geometry_generator_symbol>` symbol layer;
* doing some :ref:`geoprocessing <label_processing>`.

The Expression builder dialog offers access to the:

* :ref:`Expression tab <functions_list>` which, thanks to a list of predefined
  functions, helps to write and check the expression to use;
* :ref:`Function Editor tab <function_editor>` which helps to extend the list of
  functions by creating custom ones.

**Some use cases of expressions:**

* From Field Calculator, calculate a "pop_density" field using existing "total_pop"
  and "area_km2" fields::

    "total_pop" / "area_km2"

* Update the field "density_level" with categories according to the "pop_density" values::

    CASE WHEN "pop_density" < 50 THEN 'Low population density'
         WHEN "pop_density" >= 50 and "pop_density" < 150 THEN 'Medium population density'
         WHEN "pop_density" >= 150 THEN 'High population density'
    END

* Apply a categorized style to all the features according to whether their average house
  price is smaller or higher than 10000€ per square metre::

    "price_m2" > 10000

* Using the "Select By Expression..." tool, select all the features representing
  areas of “High population density” and whose average house price is higher than
  10000€ per square metre::

    "density_level" = 'High population density' and "price_m2" > 10000

  Likewise, the previous expression could also be used to define which features
  should be labeled or shown in the map.

Using expressions offers you a lot of possibilities.

.. index:: Named parameters
   single: Expressions; Named parameters
   single: Functions; Named parameters

.. tip:: **Use named parameters to improve the expression reading**

  Some functions require many parameters to be set. The expression engine supports the
  use of named parameters. This means that instead of writing the cryptic expression
  ``clamp( 1, 2, 9)``, you can use ``clamp( min:=1, value:=2, max:=9)``. This also allows
  arguments to be switched, e.g. ``clamp( value:=2, max:=9, min:=1)``. Using named parameters
  helps clarify what the arguments for an expression function refer to, which is helpful
  when you are trying to interpret an expression at a later date!


.. index:: Functions
.. _functions_list:

List of functions
=================

The :guilabel:`Expression` tab provides the main interface to write expressions
using functions, layer's fields and values. It contains following widgets:

* An expression editor area to type or paste expressions. Autocompletion is
  available to speed expression writing:

  * Corresponding variables, function names and field names to the input text
    are shown below: use the :kbd:`Up` and :kbd:`Down` arrows to browse the
    items and press :kbd:`Tab` to insert in the expression or simply click
    on the wished item.
  * Function parameters are shown while filling them.

  QGIS also checks the expression rightness and highlights all the errors using:

  * *Underline*: for unknown functions, wrong or invalid arguments;
  * *Marker*: for every other error (eg, missing parenthesis, unexpected
    character) at a single location.

  .. tip:: **Document your expression with comments**

    When using complex expression, it is good practice to add
    text either as a multiline comment or inline comments to help you remember.

    ::

      /*
      Labels each region with its highest (in altitude) airport(s)
      and altitude, eg 'AMBLER : 264m' for the 'Northwest Artic' region
      */
      with_variable(
        'airport_alti', -- stores the highest altitude of the region
        aggregate(
          'airports',
          'max',
          "ELEV", -- the field containing the altitude
          -- and limit the airports to the region they are within
          filter := within( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) )
        ),
          aggregate( -- finds airports at the same altitude in the region 
            'airports',
            'concatenate',
            "NAME",
            filter := within( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) )
              and "ELEV" = @airport_alti
          )
          || ' : ' || @airport_alti || 'm'
          -- using || allows regions without airports to be skipped
      )

* Under the expression editor, an :guilabel:`Output preview` displays the result
  of the expression evaluated on the first feature of the layer. In case of
  error, it indicates it and you can access details with the provided hyperlink.
* A function selector displays the list of functions, variables, fields...
  organized in groups. A search box is available to filter the list and quickly
  find a particular function or field.
  Double-clicking an item adds it to the expression editor.
* A help panel displays help for each selected item in the function selector.

  .. tip::

   Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Click` when hovering a function name in an expression to
   automatically display its help in the dialog.

* A field's values widget shown when a field is selected in the function selector
  helps to fetch features attributes. Double-clicking a value adds it to the
  expression editor.

.. tip::

   The right panel, showing functions help or field values, can be
   collapsed (invisible) in the dialog. Press the :guilabel:`Show Values`
   or :guilabel:`Show Help` button to get it back.

.. only:: html

   |

This group also shares several functions with the :ref:`conversion_functions` (
to_date, to_time, to_datetime, to_interval) and :ref:`string_functions`
(format_date) groups.

**Some examples:**

* Get today's month and year in the "month_number/year" format:

  .. code-block:: sql

     format_date(now(),'MM/yyyy')
     -- Returns '03/2017'

Besides these functions, subtracting dates, datetimes or times using the
``-`` (minus) operator will return an interval.

Adding or subtracting an interval to dates, datetimes or times, using the
``+`` (plus) and ``-`` (minus) operators, will return a datetime.

* Get the number of days until QGIS 3.0 release:

  .. code-block:: sql

     to_date('2017-09-29') - to_date(now())
     -- Returns <interval: 203 days>

* The same with time:

  .. code-block:: sql

     to_datetime('2017-09-29 12:00:00') - to_datetime(now())
     -- Returns <interval: 202.49 days>

* Get the datetime of 100 days from now:

  .. code-block:: sql

     now() + to_interval('100 days')
     -- Returns <datetime: 2017-06-18 01:00:00>

.. note:: **Storing date and datetime and intervals on fields**

   The ability to store *date*, *time* and *datetime* values directly on
   fields may depend on the data source's provider (e.g., Shapefile accepts
   *date* format, but not *datetime* or *time* format). The following are some
   suggestions to overcome this limitation:

   * *date*, *Datetime* and *time* can be stored in text type fields after
     using the ``to_format()`` function.

   * *Intervals* can be stored in integer or decimal type fields after using
     one of the date extraction functions (e.g., ``day()`` to get the interval
     expressed in days)

.. _fields_values:

Fields and Values
------------------

Contains a list of fields from the layer.

Double-click a field name to have it added to your expression. You can also
type the field name (preferably inside double quotes) or its :ref:`alias
<configure_field>`.

To retrieve fields values to use in an expression, select the appropriate field
and, in the shown widget, choose between :guilabel:`10 Samples` and :guilabel:`All
Unique`. Requested values are then displayed and you can use the :guilabel:`Search`
box at the top of the list to filter the result.
Sample values can also be accessed via right-clicking on a field.

To add a value to the expression you are writing, double-click on it in the list.
If the value is of a string type, it should be simple quoted, otherwise no quote
is needed.

**About fields concatenation**

You can concatenate strings or field values using either ``||`` or ``+``
operators or the ``concat`` function, with some special characteristics:

* The ``+`` operator also means sum up expression, so if you have an integer
  (field or numeric value) operand, this can be error prone and you better use
  the others::

   'My feature''s id is: ' + "gid" => triggers an error as gid is an integer

* When any of the arguments is a NULL value, either ``||`` or ``+`` will
  return a NULL value. To return the other arguments regardless the NULL value,
  you may want to use the ``concat`` function::

   "country_name" || NULL => NULL
   concat('My feature''s id is: ', NULL) => My feature's id is
   concat("firstname", "nickname", "lastname") => Chuck Norris (if empty nickname)
   "firstname" + "nickname" + "lastname" => NULL (if one field is empty)

* For other cases, do at your convenience::

   'My country is ' + "country_name" + ' (' + "country_code" + ')'
   'My country is ' || "country_name" || ' (' || "country_code" || ')'
   concat('My country is ', "country_name", ' (', "country_code", ')')
   # All the above return: My country is France (FR)

**Some examples:**

* Return the X coordinate of a map item center to insert into a label in layout::

   x( map_get( item_variables( 'map1'), 'map_extent_center' ) )

* Return for each feature in the current layer the number of overlapping airports
  features::

   aggregate( layer:='airport', aggregate:='count', expression:="code",
                  filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) ) )

* Get the object_id of the first snapped point of a line::

   with_variable(
     'first_snapped_point',
     array_first( @snapping_results ),
     attribute(
       get_feature_by_id(
         map_get( @first_snapped_point, 'layer' ),
         map_get( @first_snapped_point, 'feature_id' )
       ),
       'object_id'
     )
   )


Recent Functions
-----------------

This group contains recently used functions. Depending on the context of its
usage (feature selection, field calculator, generic), any applied expression
is added to the corresponding list (up to ten expressions), sorted from the
more recent to the less one.
This helps to quickly retrieve and reapply any previously used expression.

Function Editor
===============

With the :guilabel:`Function Editor` tab, you are able to write your own functions
in Python language. This provides a handy and comfortable way to address
particular needs that would not be covered by the predefined functions.

.. _figure_expression_function:

.. figure:: img/function_editor.png

   The Function Editor tab

To create a new function:

#. Press the |signPlus| :sup:`New File` button.
#. Enter a name to use in the form that pops up and press :guilabel:`OK`.

   A new item of the name you provide is added in the left panel of the
   :guilabel:`Function Editor` tab; this is a Python :file:`.py` file based on
   QGIS template file and stored in the :file:`/python/expressions` folder
   under the active :ref:`user profile <user_profiles>` directory.
#. The right panel displays the content of the file: a python script template.
   Update the code and its help according to your needs.
#. Press the |start| :guilabel:`Save and Load Functions` button.
   The function you wrote is added to the functions tree in the :guilabel:`Expression`
   tab, by default under the ``Custom`` group.
#. Enjoy your new function.
#. If the function requires improvements, enable the :guilabel:`Function Editor`
   tab, do the changes and press again the |start| :guilabel:`Save and Load
   Functions` button to make them available in the file, hence in any expression
   tab.

Custom Python functions are stored under the user profile directory, meaning that at
each QGIS startup, it will auto load all the functions defined with the current user
profile. Be aware that new functions are only saved in the :file:`/python/expressions`
folder and not in the project file.
If you share a project that uses one of your custom functions you will need to also
share the :file:`.py` file in the :file:`/python/expressions` folder.

Here's a short example on how to create your own functions:

.. code-block:: python

   from qgis.core import *
   from qgis.gui import *

   @qgsfunction(args='auto', group='Custom')
   def my_sum(value1, value2, feature, parent):
       """
       Calculates the sum of the two parameters value1 and value2.
       <h2>Example usage:</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>my_sum(5, 8) -> 13</li>
         <li>my_sum("field1", "field2") -> 42</li>
       </ul>
       """
       return value1 + value2


The short example creates a function ``my_sum`` that will give you a function
with two values.
When using the ``args='auto'`` function argument the number of function
arguments required will be calculated by the number of arguments the function
has been defined with in Python (minus 2 - ``feature``, and ``parent``).

This function can then be used in expressions:

   Custom Function added to the Expression tab

:ref:`PyQGIS-Developer-Cookbook`.
