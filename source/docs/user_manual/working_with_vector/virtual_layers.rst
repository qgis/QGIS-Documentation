Virtual layers
==============

A special kind of vector layer allows you to define a layer as the result of an
advanced query, using the SQL language on any number of other vector layers that
QGIS is able to open. These layers are called virtual layers: they do not carry
data by themselves and can be seen as views to other layers.

Creating a virtual layer
------------------------

Open the virtual layer creation dialog by clicking on 
:guilabel:`Add Virtual Layer` in the :guilabel:`Layer` menu or from the 
corresponding toolbar.

The dialog allows you to specify an SQL query. The query can use the name (or
id) of existing vector layers as well as field names of these layers.

For example, if you have a layer called ``regions``, you can create a new 
virtual layer with an SQL query like ``SELECT * FROM regions WHERE id < 100``.
The SQL query will be executed, whatever the underlying provider of the 
``regions`` layer is and even if this provider does not directly support SQL 
queries.

Joins and complex queries can also be created simply by directly using the 
names of the layers that are to be joined.

Embedded layers
---------------

Besides the vector layers available in the map canvas, the user can add layers
to the :guilabel:`Embedded layers` list, which he can use in queries
without the need to have them showing in the map canvas or Layers panel.

To embed a layer, click :guilabel:`Add` and provide the :guilabel:`Local name`,
:guilabel:`Provider`, :guilabel:`Encoding` and the path to the
:guilabel:`Source`.

The :guilabel:`Import` button allows adding layers loaded in the map canvas into
the Embedded layers list. This allows to later remove those layers from the
Layers panel without breaking any existent query.

Supported language
------------------

The underlying engine uses SQLite and Spatialite to operate.

It means you can use all of the SQL your local installation of SQLite 
understands.

Functions from SQLite and spatial functions from Spatialite
can also be used in a virtual layer query. For instance, creating a point
layer out of a attribute-only layer can be done with a query similar to:
``SELECT id, MakePoint(x, y, 4326) as geometry FROM coordinates``

:ref:`Functions of QGIS expressions<functions_list>` can also be used in a 
virtual layer query.

To refer the geometry column of a layer, use the name ``geometry``.

Contrary to a pure SQL query, all the fields of a virtual layer query must 
be named. Don't forget to use the ``as`` keyword to name your columns if they 
are the result of a computation or function call.

Performance issues
------------------

With default parameters set, the virtual layer engine will try its best to 
detect the type of the different columns of the query, including the type of the
geometry column if one is present.

This is done by introspecting the query when possible or by fetching the first 
row of the query (LIMIT 1) at last resort.
Fetching the first row of the result just to create the layer may be undesirable 
for performance reasons.

The creation dialog allows to specify different parameters:

* **unique identifier column**: this option allows to specify which field of 
  the query represents unique integer values that QGIS can use as row 
  identifiers. By default, an autoincrementing integer value is used. 
  Specifying a unique identifier column allows to speed up selection of rows by
  id.

* **no geometry**: this option forces the virtual layer to ignore any geometry 
  field. The resulting layer is an attribute-only layer.

* **geometry column**: this option allows to specify the name of the column 
  that is to be used as the geometry of the layer.

* **geometry type**: this option allows to specify the type of the geometry of 
  the virtual layer.

* **geometry CRS**: this option allows to specify the coordinate reference 
  system of the virtual layer.

Special comments
----------------

The virtual layer engine tries to determine the type of each column of the 
query. If it fails, the first row of the query is fetched to determine 
column types.

The type of a particular column can be specified directly in the query by 
using some special comments.

The syntax is the following: ``/*:type*/``. It has to be placed just after
the name of a column. ``type`` can be either ``int`` for integers, ``real`` 
for floating point numbers or ``text``.

For instance:
``SELECT id+1 as nid /*:int*/ FROM table``

The type and coordinate reference system of the geometry column can also be set
thanks to special comments with the following syntax ``/*:gtype:srid*/`` where 
``gtype`` is the geometry type (``point``, ``linestring``, ``polygon``,
``multipoint``, ``multilinestring`` or ``multipolygon``) and ``srid`` an 
integer representing the EPSG code of a coordinate reference system.

Use of indexes
--------------

When requesting a layer through a virtual layer, indexes of this source layer 
will be used in the following ways:

* if an ``=`` predicate is used on the primary key column of the layer, the 
  underlying data provider will be asked for a particular id (FilterFid)

* for any other predicates (``>``, ``<=``, ``!=``, etc.) or on a column without
  primary key, a request built from an expression will be used to request the 
  underlying vector data provider. It means indexes may be used on database
  providers if they exist.

A specific syntax exists to handle spatial predicates in requests and trigger 
the use of a spatial index: a hidden column named ``_search_frame_`` exists
for each virtual layer. This column can be compared for equality to a bounding 
box. Example:
``select * from vtab where _search_frame_=BuildMbr(-2.10,49.38,-1.3,49.99,4326)``

Spatial binary predicates like ``ST_Intersects`` are greatly sped up when used 
in conjunction with this spatial index syntax.
