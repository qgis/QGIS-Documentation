The Vector Properties Dialog
============================

The :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog for a vector layer provides information
about the layer, symbology settings and labeling options. If your vector layer
has been loaded from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS datastore, you can also alter the
underlying SQL for the layer by invoking the :guilabel:`Query Builder` dialog on
the :guilabel:`General` tab. To access the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog,
double-click on a layer in the legend or right-click on the layer and select
:menuselection:`Properties` from the popup menu.

.. _vector_style_menu:

Style Menu
---------

The Style menu provides you with a comprehensive tool for rendering and symbolizing your 
vector data. You can use :menuselection:`Layer rendering -->` tools that are common to
all vector data and special symbolizing tools that were designed for the different kinds
of vector data. 

Layer rendering
...............

* :guilabel:`Layer transparency` |slider|: you can make the underlying layer in the map canvas
  visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your vector layer to your needs.
  You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the the menu beside the slider.
* :guilabel:`Layer blending mode`: you can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you 
  previously only know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed
  through the settings described below.

	* Normal: This is the standard blend mode which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the
	  Pixel beneath it; the colors aren't mixed
	* Lighten: It selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged
	  and harsh.
	* Screen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is
 	  most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer. E.g. you can use a hillshade to texture another layer
	* Dodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So brighter top pixels 
          cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top
          pixels aren't too bright, otherwise the effect is too extreme.
	* Addition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above 1 (in the case of RGB), white is
          displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.
	* Darken: Creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the 
	  results tend to be jagged and harsh
	* Multiply: It multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the top layer with the corresponding pixel for the bottom layer.
          The results are darker pictures.
	* Burn: Darker colors in the top layer causes the underlying layers to darken. Can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.
	* Overlay: Combines multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture light parts of the picture become lighter and dark parts become
          darker. 
	* Soft light: Very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This one is supposed to emulate shining a soft
          light onto an image.
	* Hard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It's supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.
	* Difference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel or the other way round, to always get a positive value. Blending with
          black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0.
	* Subtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.
  

.. index:: Symbology

Since |qg| 2.0.0 the old symbology is no longer available.
In this version the new symbology has been redesigned and revised. 


Renderers
.........

The renderer is responsible for drawing a feature together with the correct
symbol. There are four types of renderers: single symbol, categorized, graduated and rule-based.
There is no continuous color renderer, because it is in fact only a special case
of the graduated renderer. The categorized and graduated renderer can be created
by specifying a symbol and a color ramp - they will set the colors for symbols
appropriately. For point layers there is a point displacement renderer available.
For each data type (points, lines and polygons) vector symbol layer types are available
(see vector_symbol_types_). Depending on the chosen renderer, the :guilabel:`Style` menu provides different
following sections. On the bottom right of the symbology dialog there is a **[Symbol]** button which gives access
to the Style Manager (see Section :ref:`vector_style_manager`). The Style Manager allows you to edit and remove
existing symbols and add new ones.


.. _tip_change_multiple_symbols:

.. tip:: **Select and change multiple symbols**

   The Symbology allows to select multiple symbols and right
   click to change color, transparency, size, or width of selected
   entries.

.. index:: Single_Symbol_Renderer, Renderer_Single_Symbol

**Single Symbol Renderer**

The Single Symbol Renderer is used to render all features of the layer using
a single user-defined symbol. The properties, that can be adjusted in the
:guilabel:`Style` menu, depend partially on the type of the layer, but all types share
the following structure. In the top left part of the tab, there is a preview
of the current symbol to be rendered. On the right part of the tab, there is
a list of symbols already defined for the current style, prepared to be used
via selecting them from the list. The current symbol can be modified using
the menu on the right side.
If you click on the first level in the :guilabel:`Symbol layers` dialog on the left
side it's possible to define basic parameters like :guilabel:`Size`, :guilabel:`Transparency`, :guilabel:`Color` 
and :guilabel:`Rotation`. Here the layers are joined together.

   Single symbol line properties |nix|

More detailed settings can be made when clicking on the second level in the 
:guilabel:`Symbol layers` dialog. You can define :guilabel:`Symbol layers` that are
combined afterwards. A symbol can consist of several :guilabel:`Symbol layers`.
The following settings are possible:

* :guilabel:`Symbol layer type` You have the possibility to use Ellipse markers, Font markers, 
  Simple markers, SVG markers and Vector Field markers
* :guilabel:`Size`
* :guilabel:`Angle`
* :guilabel:`Colors`
* :guilabel:`Border width`
* :guilabel:`Offset X,Y` You can shift the symbol in x- or y-direction

Note that once you have set the size in the lower levels the size of the whole symbol
can be changed with the :guilabel:`Size` menu in the first level again. The size of
the lower levels changes accordingly while the size ratio is maintained.
After having done any needed changes, the symbol can be added to the list of
current style symbols (using the **[Symbol]** |selectstring| :guilabel:`Save in symbol library`)
and then easily be used in the future. Furthermore you can use the **[Save Style]** |selectstring| button to
save the symbol as a QGIS layer style file (.qml) or SLD file(.sld). Currently
in version 1.8 SLDs can be exported from any type of renderer: single symbol,
categorized, graduated or rule-based, but when importing an SLD, either a
single symbol or rule-based renderer is created.
That means that categorized or graduated styles are converted to rule-based.
If you want to preserve those renderers, you have to stick to the QML format.
On the other hand, it could be very handy sometimes to have this easy way of
converting styles to rule-based.


.. index:: Categorized_Renderer, Renderer_Categorized

**Categorized Renderer**


The Categorized Renderer is used to render all features from a layer, using
a single user-defined symbol, which color reflects the value of a selected
feature's attribute. The :guilabel:`Style` menu allows you to select:


* The attribute (using the Column listbox)
* The symbol (using the Symbol dialog)
* The colors (using the Color Ramp listbox)


The **[Advanced]** button in the lower right corner of the dialog allows to
set the fields containing rotation and size scale information.
For convenience, the list in the center of the menu lists the values of
all currently selected attributes together, including the symbols that will
be rendered.

The example in figure_symbology_2_ shows the category rendering dialog used
for the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

You can create a custom color ramp choosing :menuselection:`New color ramp...`
from the Color ramp dropdown menu. A dialog will prompt for the ramp type:
Gradient, Random, ColorBrewer, then each one has options for number of steps
and/or multiple stops in the color ramp. See figure_symbology_3_ for an
example of custom color ramp.

**Graduated Renderer**

The Graduated Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using
a single user-defined symbol, whose color reflects the classification of a
selected feature's attribute to a class.


.. _figure_symbology_4:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Symbology 4:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_vector/graduatesymbol_ng_line.png
   :width: 25em
   :align: center

   Graduated Symbolizing options |nix|

Like Categorized Renderer, it allows
to define rotation and size scale from specified columns.

Analogue to the categorized rendered, the :guilabel:`Style` tab allows you to
select:


* The attribute (using the Column listbox)
* The symbol (using the Symbol Properties button)
* The colors (using the Color Ramp list)

Additionally, you can specify the number of classes and also the mode how to
classify features inside the classes (using the Mode list). The available
modes are:

* Equal Interval
* Quantile
* Natural Breaks (Jenks)
* Standard Deviation
* Pretty Breaks


The listbox in the center part of the :guilabel:`Style` menu lists the classes
together with their ranges, labels and symbols that will be rendered.

The example in figure_symbology_4_ shows the graduated rendering dialog for
the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

.. Index:: Rule-based_Rendering, Rendering_Rule-based

**Rule-based rendering**

The rule-based renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using
rule based symbols, whose color reflects the classification of a selected
feature's attribute to a class. The rules are based on SQL statements. The dialog
allows rule grouping by filter or scale and you can decide if you want to enable
symbol levels or use only first matched rule.

The example in figure_symbology_5_ shows the rule-based rendering dialog
for the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

To create a rule, activate an existing row by clicking on it or click on '+' and
click on the new rule. Then press the **[Edit rule]** button. In the :guilabel:`Rule
properties` dialog you can define a label for the rule. Press the |browsebutton|
button to open the Expression builder. In the **Function List**, click on
:guilabel:`Fields and Values` to view all attributes of the attribute table to
be searched. To add an attribute to the Field calculator **Expression** field,
double click its name in the :guilabel:`Fields and Values` list. Generally you
can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation
expression or you can just type it into the box (see :ref:`vector_field_calculator`).

.. _vector_labels_tab:

Labels Menu
-----------

|labels| |qg| 2.0.0 currently provides an old and a deprecated labeling
engine in parallel. The :guilabel:`Labels` tab still contains the old labeling.
The new labeling is implemented as a core application and will replace the features
of the old labels tab in one of the next versions.

We recommend to switch to the new labeling, described in section
:ref:`vector_new_labeling`.

Labels (deprecated)
...................

The deprecated labeling in the :guilabel:`Labels` tab allows you to enable labeling
features and control a number of options related to fonts, placement, style,
alignment and buffering. We will illustrate this by labeling the lakes
shapefile of the QGIS sample dataset:


#. Load the Shapefile :file:`alaska.shp` and GML file :file:`lakes.gml`
   in |qg|
#. Zoom in a bit to your favorite area with some lake
#. Make the 'lakes' layer active
#. Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog
#. In the :guilabel:`Layers (deprecated)` menu click on the :guilabel:`Label Properties` tab.
#. Check the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Display labels` checkbox to enable labeling
#. Choose the field to label with. We will use
   :guilabel:`Field containing label` |selectstring| 'NAMES'
#. Enter a default for lakes that have no name. The default label will be
   used each time |qg| encounters a lake with no value in the 'NAMES' field.
#. If you have labels extending over several lines, check
   |checkbox|:guilabel:`Multiline labels?`. |qg| will check for a true line
   return in your label field and insert the line breaks accordingly.
   A true line return is a **single** character ``\n``, (not two separate
   characters, like a backlash ``\`` followed by the character ``n``).  To insert
   line returns in an attribute field configure the edit widget to be text
   edit (not line edit).
#. Click **[Apply]**.

Now we have labels. How do they look? They are probably too big and poorly
placed in relation to the marker symbol for the lakes.

Select the :guilabel:`Font size` |selectstring| and use the **[Font]** and **[Color]** buttons to
set the font and color. Define if your labels should be rendered in points or in map units.
You can also change the angle and the placement of the text-label.

To change the position of the text relative to the feature:

#. Beneath the Basic label options change the placement by selecting one of the
   radio buttons in the :guilabel:`Placement` group. To fix our labels, choose
   the |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Right` radio button.
#. Click **[Apply]** to see your changes without closing the dialog.

Things are looking better, but the labels are still too close to the marker.
To fix this we can use the options on the ``Offset`` entry which is on the bottom
of the menu. Here we can add offsets for the X and Y directions. Adding an X
offset of 5 will move our labels off the marker and make them more readable. Of
course if your marker symbol or font is larger, more of an offset will be required.

The last adjustment we'll make is to 'Buffer' the labels. This just means
putting a backdrop around them to make them stand out better. To buffer the
lakes labels:

#. Click the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Buffer Labels` checkbox to enable
   buffering.
#. Choose a size for the buffer using the spin box |selectnumber|.
#. The :guilabel:`Buffer size` menu also allows you to select between
   'In Points' or 'In Map units'.
#. Choose a color by clicking on **[Color]** and choosing your favorite
   from the color selector. You can also set some transparency for the
   buffer if you prefer.
#. Click **[Apply]** to see if you like the changes.

As a last define if the labels are shifted. Use the :guilabel:`Offset` settings and fill
in the 'X offset' and the 'Y offset' . Again, it is possible to define the :guilabel:`Offset` 'In points'
or in 'In map units'.

If you aren't happy with the results, tweak the settings and then test again by
clicking **[Apply]**.

A buffer of 1 points seems to give a good result. Notice you can also specify
the buffer size in map units if that works out better for you.

The advanced entries inside the :guilabel:`Label` menu allow you control
the appearance of the labels using attributes stored in the layer. The
entries beginning with ``Data defined`` allow you to set all the parameters
for the labels using fields in the layer.

Note that the :guilabel:`Label` tab provides a ``preview-box`` where your
selected label is shown.

.. index:: New_Labeling, Smart_Labeling

.. _vector_new_labeling:

New Labeling
------------

The new |mActionLabeling| :sup:`Labeling` core application provides smart
labeling for vector point, line and polygon layers and only requires a
few parameters. This new application will replace the current QGIS labeling,
described in section :ref:`vector_labels_tab` and also supports on-the-fly
transformated layers.

**Using new labeling**

#. Start QGIS and load a vector point, line or polygon layer.
#. Activate the layer in the legend and click on the |mActionLabeling|
   :sup:`Labeling` icon in the QGIS toolbar menu.

**Labeling point layers**

First step is to activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Label this layer` checkbox
and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click |browsebutton| if you
want to define labels based on expressions. After that you can define the text
style and the scale-based visibility in the :guilabel:`Label settings` tab (see
Figure_labels_1_ ). Choose the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab for the label placement
and the labeling priority. You can define if every part of a multipart feature
is to be labeled here. With the wrap label on character function you can define
a character for a line break in the labels. The :guilabel:`Data defined settings`
tab provides you with the attribute-based definition of Font properties, Buffer
properties and Position.

can define the text style and the scale-based visibility. Further labeling options
are available through the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab. You can define the label
placement and label distance, a line orientation dependend position and the
labeling priority here. Furthermore you can define if every part of a multipart
line is to be labeled, if lines shall be merged to avoid duplicate labels and if
a direction symbol is added (see Figure_labels_2_ ). It is also possible to
supress labeling of features and wrap lables on characters. Use :guilabel:`Data
defined settings` for attribute-based or database-connection-based settings.

**Keywords to use in attribute columns for labeling**

There is a list of supported key words, that can be used for the placement
of labels in defined attribute columns.


* **For horizontal alignment**: ``left``, ``center``, ``right``
* **For vertical alignment**: ``bottom``, ``base``, ``half``, ``top``
* **Colors can be specified in svg notation**, e.g. \#ff0000
* **for bold, underlined, strikeout and italic**: 0 = false 1 = true

A combination of key words in one column also works, e.g.: ``base right`` or
``bottom left``.

Within the :guilabel:`Fields` tab you also find an ``edit widget`` column.
This column can be used to define values or a range of values that are allowed
to be added to the specific attribute table column. If you click on the
**[edit widget]** button, a dialog opens, where you can define different
widgets. These widgets are:

* **Line edit**: an edit field which allows to enter simple text
  (or restrict to numbers for numeric attributes).
* **Classification**: Displays a combo box with the values used for
  classification, if you have chosen 'unique value' as legend type in
  the :guilabel:`Style` tab of the properties dialog.
* **Range**: Allows to set numeric values from a specific range. The edit
  widget can be either a slider or a spin box.
* **Unique values**: The user can select one of the values already used in
  the attribute table. If editable is activated, a line edit is shown with
  autocompletion support, otherwise a combo box is used.
* **File name**: Simplifies the selection by adding a file chooser dialog.
* **Value map**: a combo box with predefined items. The value is stored in
  the attribute, the description is shown in the combo box. You can define
  values manually or load them from a layer or a CSV file.
* **Enumeration**: Opens a combo box with values that can be used within
  the columns type. This is currently only supported by the postgres provider.
* **Immutable**: The immutable attribute column is read-only. The user is not
  able to modify the content.
* **Hidden**: A hidden attribute column is invisible. The user is not able
  to see its content.
* **Checkbox**: Displays a checkbox and you can define what attribute is
  added to the column when the checkbox is activated or not.
* **Text edit**: This opens a text edit field that allows multiple lines to
  be used.
* **Calendar**: Opens a calendar widget to enter a date. Column type must be
  text.
* **Value Relation**: Offers values from a related table in a combobox. You can
  select layer, key column and value column.
* **UUID Generator**: Generates a read-only UUID (Universally Unique Identifiers)
  field, if empty.

Actions Menu
------------

|action| |qg| provides the ability to perform an action based on the attributes

running a program with arguments built from the attributes of a feature or
passing parameters to a web reporting tool.

   Overview action dialog with some sample actions |nix|

Actions are useful when you frequently want to run an external application or
view a web page based on one or more values in your vector layer. They are
devided into 6 types and can be used like this:

* Generic, Mac, Windows and Unix actions start an external process,
* Python actions execute a python expression,
* Generic and Python actions are visible everywhere,
* Mac, Windows and Unix actions are visible only on the respective platform (i.e.
  you can define three 'Edit' actions to open an editor and the users can only
  see and execute the one 'Edit' action for their platform to run the editor).

There are several examples included in the dialog. You can load them clicking
on **[Add default actions]**. An example is performing a search based on an
attribute value. This concept is used in the following discussion.

.. index:: Actions, Attribute_Actions

**Defining Actions**

Attribute actions are defined from the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties`
dialog. To :index:`define an action`, open the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties`
dialog and click on the :guilabel:`Actions` tab. Select 'Generic' as type and
provide a descriptive name for the action. The action itself must contain
the name of the application that will be executed when the action is invoked.
You can add one or more attribute field values as arguments to the application.
When the action is invoked any set of characters that start with a ``%``
followed by the name of a field will be replaced by the value of that field.
The special characters :index:`%%` will be replaced by the value of the field
that was selected from the identify results or attribute table (see using_actions_
below). Double quote marks can be used to group text into a single argument to
the program, script or command. Double quotes will be ignored if preceded by a
backslash.

If you have field names that are substrings of other field names (e.g.,
``col1`` and ``col10``) you should indicate so, by surrounding the field name
(and the \% character) with square brackets (e.g., ``[%col10]``). This will
prevent the ``%col10`` field name being mistaken for the ``%col1`` field name
with a ``0`` on the end. The brackets will be removed by |qg| when it
substitutes in the value of the field. If you want the substituted field to be
surrounded by square brackets, use a second set like this: ``[[%col10]]``.

Using the :guilabel:`Identify Features` tool you can open :guilabel:`Identify Results`
dialog. It includes a *(Derived)* item that contains information relevant to the
layer type. The values in this item can be accessed in a similar way to the other
fields by using preceeding the derived field name by ``(Derived).``. For example,
a point layer has an ``X`` and ``Y`` field and the value of these can be used in
the action with ``%(Derived).X`` and ``%(Derived).Y``. The derived attributes
are only available from the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog box, not the
:guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog box.

Two :index:`example actions` are shown below:

* ``konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam``
* ``konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%%``

In the first example, the web browser konqueror is invoked and passed a URL
to open. The URL performs a Google search on the value of the ``nam`` field
from our vector layer. Note that the application or script called by the
action must be in the path or you must provide the full path. To be sure, we
could rewrite the first example as:
``/opt/kde3/bin/konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam``. This will
ensure that the konqueror application will be executed when the action is
invoked.

The second example uses the \%\% notation which does not rely on a particular
field for its value. When the action is invoked, the \%\% will be replaced by
the value of the selected field in the identify results or attribute table.

.. _using_actions:

**Using Actions**

Actions can be invoked from either the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog,
an :guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog or from :guilabel:`Run Feature Action`
(recall that these dialogs can be opened by clicking |mActionIdentify|
:sup:`Identify Features` or |mActionOpenTable| :sup:`Open Attribute Table` or
|mAction| :sup:`Run Feature Action`). To invoke an action, right
click on the record and choose the action from the popup menu. Actions are
listed in the popup menu by the name you assigned when defining the actions.
Click on the action you wish to invoke.

If you are invoking an action that uses the ``%%`` notation, right-click on the
field value in the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog or the
:guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog that you wish to pass to the application
or script.

Here is another example that pulls data out of a vector layer and inserts
them into a file using bash and the ``echo`` command (so it will only work
|nix| or perhaps |osx|). The layer in question has fields for a species name
``taxon_name``, latitude ``lat`` and longitude ``long``. I would like to be
able to make a spatial selection of a localities and export these field values
to a text file for the selected record (shown in yellow in the |qg| map area).
Here is the action to achieve this:

::


  bash -c "echo \"%taxon_name %lat %long\" >> /tmp/species_localities.txt"


After selecting a few localities and running the action on each one, opening
the output file will show something like this:

::


  Acacia mearnsii -34.0800000000 150.0800000000
  Acacia mearnsii -34.9000000000 150.1200000000
  Acacia mearnsii -35.2200000000 149.9300000000
  Acacia mearnsii -32.2700000000 150.4100000000


As an exercise we create an action that does a Google search on the ``lakes``
layer. First we need to determine the URL needed to perform a search on a
keyword. This is easily done by just going to Google and doing a simple
search, then grabbing the URL from the address bar in your browser. From this
little effort we see that the format is: http://google.com/search?q=qgis,
where ``QGIS`` is the search term. Armed with this information, we can proceed:

#. Make sure the ``lakes`` layer is loaded.
#. Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog by double-clicking on the
   layer in the legend or right-click and choose :guilabel:`Properties`
   from the popup menu.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Actions` tab.
#. Enter a name for the action, for example ``Google Search``.
#. For the action, we need to provide the name of the external program to run.
   In this case, we can use Firefox. If the program is not in your path, you
   need to provide the full path.
#. Following the name of the external application, add the URL used for doing
   a Google search, up to but not included the search term:
   ``http://google.com/search?q=``
#. The text in the :guilabel:`Action` field should now look like this:
   ``firefox http://google.com/search?q=``
#. Click on the drop-down box containing the field names for the ``lakes``
   layer. It's located just to the left of the **[Insert Field]** button.
#. From the drop-down box :guilabel:`The valid attribute names for this layer`
   |selectstring| select 'NAMES' and click **[Insert Field]**.
#. Your action text now looks like this:

   ``firefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES``
#. To finalize the action click the **[Insert action]** button.


This completes the action and it is ready to use. The final text of the
action should look like this:

::

   firefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES

We can now use the action. Close the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog and
zoom in to an area of interest. Make sure the ``lakes`` layer is active and
identify a lake. In the result box you'll now see that our action is visible:

   Select feature and choose action |nix|

When we click on the action, it brings up Firefox and navigates to the URL
http://www.google.com/search?q=Tustumena. It is also possible to add further
attribute fields to the action. Therefore you can add a ``+`` to the end of
the action text, select another field and click on **[Insert Field]**. In
this example there is just no other field available that would make sense
to search for.

You can define multiple actions for a layer and each will show up in the
:guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog.

.. % FIXME No longer valid??
.. %You can also invoke actions from the attribute table
.. %by selecting a row and right-clicking, then choosing the action from the popup
.. %menu.

You can think of all kinds of uses for actions. For example, if you have
a point layer containing locations of images or photos along with a file name,
you could create an action to launch a viewer to display the image. You could
also use actions to launch web-based reports for an attribute field or
combination of fields, specifying them in the same way we did in our
Google search example.

We can also make more complex examples, for instance on how to use **Python**
actions.

Usually when we create an action to open a file with an external application
we can use absolute paths, or eventually relative paths, in the second case
the path is relative to the location of the external program executable file.
But what about we need to use relative paths, relative to the selected layer
(a file based one, like a shapefile or spatialite)? The following code will
do the trick:

::


  command = "firefox";
  imagerelpath = "images_test/test_image.jpg";
  layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer();
  import os.path;
  layerpath = layer.source() if layer.providerType() == 'ogr' else (qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI(layer.source()).database() if layer.providerType() == 'spatialite' else None);
  path = os.path.dirname(str(layerpath));
  image = os.path.join(path,imagerelpath);
  import subprocess;
  subprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );

we have to just remember that the action is one of type *Python* and to
change the *command* and *imagerelpath* variables to fit our needs.

But what about if the relative path need to be relative to the (saved)
project file? The code of the Python action would be:

::


  command="firefox";
  imagerelpath="images/test_image.jpg";
  projectpath=qgis.core.QgsProject.instance().fileName();
  import os.path; path=os.path.dirname(str(projectpath)) if projectpath != '' else None;
  image=os.path.join(path, imagerelpath);
  import subprocess;
  subprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );

Another Python actions example if the one that allows us to add new layers
to the project. For instance the following examples will add to the project
respectively a vector and a raster. The name of files to be added to the
project and the name to be given to the layer are data driven (*filename* and
*layname* are column names of the table of attributes of the vector where
the action was created):

::


  qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer('/yourpath/[% "filename" %].shp','[% "layername" %]', 'ogr')


To add a raster (a tif image in this example) it becomes:

::


  qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer('/yourpath/[% "filename" %].tif','[% "layername" %]')

Joins Menu
----------


|join| The :guilabel:`Joins` tab allows you to :index:`join a loaded attribute table
to a loaded vector layer`. As key columns you have to define a :index:`join
layer`, a join field and a target field. QGIS currently supports to join non
spatial table formats supported by OGR, delimited text and the PostgreSQL
provider (see figure_joins_1_).

Diagrams Menu
-------------

|diagram| The :guilabel:`Diagrams` tab allows you to add a graphic overlay to a
vector layer (see figure_diagrams_1_).

The current core implementation of diagrams provides support for piecharts
and text diagrams. Text values ​​of different data columns are displayed one
below the other with a circle or a box and dividers. Diagram size is based
on a fixed size or on linear scaling according to a classification attribute.
The placement of the diagrams interacts with the new labeling, so position
conflicts between diagrams and labels are detected and solved. In addition
to chart positions can be fixed by the users hand.

   Vector properties dialog with diagram tab |nix|

We will demonstrate an example and overlay the alaska boundary layer a
text diagram showing some temperature data from a climate vector layer.
Both vector layers are part of the |qg| sample dataset (see Section
:ref:`label_sampledata`).

#. First click on the |mActionAddOgrLayer| :sup:`Load Vector` icon, browse
   to the |qg| sample dataset folder and load the two vector shape layers
   :file:`alaska.shp` and :file:`climate.shp`.
#. Double click the ``climate`` layer in the map legend to open the
   :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Diagrams` tab, activate :guilabel:`Display diagrams`
   and from :guilabel:`Diagram type` |selectstring| combobox select 'Text diagram'
#. As Background color we choose a light blue and set a fixed size to 18 mm.
#. Placement could be set to AroundPoint.
#. In the diagram we want to display the values of the three columns
   ``T_F_JAN``, ``T_F_JUL`` and ``T_F_MEAN``. First select ``T_F_JAN`` as
   Attributes and click the green **[\+]** button, then ``T_F_JUL`` and
   finally ``T_F_MEAN``.
#. Now click **[Apply]** to display the diagram in the |qg| main window.
#. You can now adapt the chart size, or change the attribute colors by double
   clicking on the color values in the attribute field. Figure_diagrams_2_
   gives an impression.
#. Finally click **[Ok]**.

Additionally in the :menuselection:`Settings --> Options` dialog, there is a
``Overlay`` tab where it is possible to select the placement algorithm of the diagrams.
The central point method is a generic one, the others use algorithms of the PAL library.
They also consider diagram objects and labels in different layers. Also see section
:ref:`diagram_overlay` for additional diagram features.
