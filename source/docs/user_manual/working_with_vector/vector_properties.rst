The Vector Properties Dialog
============================

The :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog for a vector layer provides information
about the layer, symbology settings and labeling options. If your vector layer
has been loaded from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS datastore, you can also alter the
underlying SQL for the layer by invoking the :guilabel:`Query Builder` dialog on
the :guilabel:`General` tab. To access the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog,
double-click on a layer in the legend or right-click on the layer and select
:menuselection:`Properties` from the popup menu.

.. _vector_style_menu:

Style Menu
----------

The Style menu provides you with a comprehensive tool for rendering and symbolizing your 
vector data. You can use :menuselection:`Layer rendering -->` tools that are common to
all vector data and special symbolizing tools that were designed for the different kinds
of vector data. 

Layer rendering
...............

* :guilabel:`Layer transparency` |slider|: you can make the underlying layer in the map canvas
  visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your vector layer to your needs.
  You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the the menu beside the slider.

.. _blend_modes:

* :guilabel:`Layer blending mode`: you can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you 
  previously only know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed
  through the settings described below.

	* Normal: This is the standard blend mode which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the
	  Pixel beneath it; the colors aren't mixed
	* Lighten: It selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged
	  and harsh.
	* Screen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is
 	  most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer. E.g. you can use a hillshade to texture another layer
	* Dodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So brighter top pixels 
          cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top
          pixels aren't too bright, otherwise the effect is too extreme.
	* Addition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above 1 (in the case of RGB), white is
          displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.
	* Darken: Creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the 
	  results tend to be jagged and harsh
	* Multiply: It multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the top layer with the corresponding pixel for the bottom layer.
          The results are darker pictures.
	* Burn: Darker colors in the top layer causes the underlying layers to darken. Can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.
	* Overlay: Combines multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture light parts of the picture become lighter and dark parts become
          darker. 
	* Soft light: Very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This one is supposed to emulate shining a soft
          light onto an image.
	* Hard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It's supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.
	* Difference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel or the other way round, to always get a positive value. Blending with
          black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0.
	* Subtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with tshe other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.
  

.. index:: Symbology

Since |qg| 2.0.0 the old symbology is no longer available.
In this version the new symbology has been redesigned and revised. 


Renderers
.........

The renderer is responsible for drawing a feature together with the correct
symbol. There are four types of renderers: single symbol, categorized, graduated and rule-based.
There is no continuous color renderer, because it is in fact only a special case
of the graduated renderer. The categorized and graduated renderer can be created
by specifying a symbol and a color ramp - they will set the colors for symbols
appropriately. For point layers there is a point displacement renderer available.
For each data type (points, lines and polygons) vector symbol layer types are available
(see vector_symbol_types_). Depending on the chosen renderer, the :guilabel:`Style` menu provides different
following sections. On the bottom right of the symbology dialog there is a **[Symbol]** button which gives access
to the Style Manager (see Section :ref:`vector_style_manager`). The Style Manager allows you to edit and remove
existing symbols and add new ones.


.. _tip_change_multiple_symbols:

.. tip:: **Select and change multiple symbols**

   The Symbology allows to select multiple symbols and right
   click to change color, transparency, size, or width of selected
   entries.

.. index:: Single_Symbol_Renderer, Renderer_Single_Symbol

**Single Symbol Renderer**

The Single Symbol Renderer is used to render all features of the layer using
a single user-defined symbol. The properties, that can be adjusted in the
:guilabel:`Style` menu, depend partially on the type of the layer, but all types share
the following structure. In the top left part of the tab, there is a preview
of the current symbol to be rendered. On the right part of the tab, there is
a list of symbols already defined for the current style, prepared to be used
via selecting them from the list. The current symbol can be modified using
the menu on the right side.
If you click on the first level in the :guilabel:`Symbol layers` dialog on the left
side it's possible to define basic parameters like :guilabel:`Size`, :guilabel:`Transparency`, :guilabel:`Color` 
and :guilabel:`Rotation`. Here the layers are joined together.

   Single symbol line properties |nix|

More detailed settings can be made when clicking on the second level in the 
:guilabel:`Symbol layers` dialog. You can define :guilabel:`Symbol layers` that are
combined afterwards. A symbol can consist of several :guilabel:`Symbol layers`.
The following settings are possible:

* :guilabel:`Symbol layer type`: You have the possibility to use Ellipse markers, Font markers, 
  Simple markers, SVG markers and Vector Field markers
* :guilabel:`Size`
* :guilabel:`Angle`
* :guilabel:`Colors`
* :guilabel:`Border width`
* :guilabel:`Offset X,Y`: You can shift the symbol in x- or y-direction

Note that once you have set the size in the lower levels the size of the whole symbol
can be changed with the :guilabel:`Size` menu in the first level again. The size of
the lower levels changes accordingly while the size ratio is maintained.
After having done any needed changes, the symbol can be added to the list of
current style symbols (using the **[Symbol]** |selectstring| :guilabel:`Save in symbol library`)
and then easily be used in the future. Furthermore you can use the **[Save Style]** |selectstring| button to
save the symbol as a QGIS layer style file (.qml) or SLD file(.sld). Currently
in version 2.0.0 SLDs can be exported from any type of renderer: single symbol,
categorized, graduated or rule-based, but when importing an SLD, either a
single symbol or rule-based renderer is created.
That means that categorized or graduated styles are converted to rule-based.
If you want to preserve those renderers, you have to stick to the QML format.
On the other hand, it could be very handy sometimes to have this easy way of
converting styles to rule-based.


.. index:: Categorized_Renderer, Renderer_Categorized

**Categorized Renderer**


The Categorized Renderer is used to render all features from a layer, using
a single user-defined symbol, which color reflects the value of a selected
feature's attribute. The :guilabel:`Style` menu allows you to select:


* The attribute (using the Column listbox)
* The symbol (using the Symbol dialog)
* The colors (using the Color Ramp listbox)


The **[Advanced]** button in the lower right corner of the dialog allows to
set the fields containing rotation and size scale information.
For convenience, the list in the center of the menu lists the values of
all currently selected attributes together, including the symbols that will
be rendered.

The example in figure_symbology_2_ shows the category rendering dialog used
for the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

.. index:: Color_Ramp, Gradient_Color_Ramp, ColorBrewer, Custom_Color_Ramp

You can create a custom color ramp choosing :menuselection:`New color ramp...`
from the :guilabel:`Color ramp` dropdown menu. A dialog will prompt for the ramp type:
Gradient, Random, ColorBrewer, and cpt-city. The first three have options for number of steps
and/or multiple stops in the color ramp. See figure_symbology_3_ for an
example of custom color ramp and figure_symbology_3a_ for the cpt-city dialog.

.. index:: Graduated_Renderer, Renderer_Graduated
.. index:: Natural_Breaks_(Jenks), Pretty_Breaks, Equal_Interval, Quantile

**Graduated Renderer**

The Graduated Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using
a single user-defined symbol, whose color reflects the classification of a
selected feature's attribute to a class.


.. _figure_symbology_4:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Symbology 4:**

   Graduated Symbolizing options |nix|

Like Categorized Renderer, it allows
to define rotation and size scale from specified columns.

Analogue to the categorized rendered, the :guilabel:`Style` tab allows you to
select:


* The attribute (using the Column listbox)
* The symbol (using the Symbol Properties button)
* The colors (using the Color Ramp list)

Additionally, you can specify the number of classes and also the mode how to
classify features inside the classes (using the Mode list). The available
modes are:

* Equal Interval
* Quantile
* Natural Breaks (Jenks)
* Standard Deviation
* Pretty Breaks


The listbox in the center part of the :guilabel:`Style` menu lists the classes
together with their ranges, labels and symbols that will be rendered.

The example in figure_symbology_4_ shows the graduated rendering dialog for
the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

.. Index:: Rule-based_Rendering, Rendering_Rule-based

**Rule-based rendering**

The rule-based renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using
rule based symbols, whose color reflects the classification of a selected
feature's attribute to a class. The rules are based on SQL statements. The dialog
allows rule grouping by filter or scale and you can decide if you want to enable
symbol levels or use only first matched rule.

The example in figure_symbology_5_ shows the rule-based rendering dialog
for the rivers layer of the |qg| sample dataset.

To create a rule, activate an existing row by clicking on it or click on '+' and
click on the new rule. Then press the **[Edit rule]** button. In the :guilabel:`Rule
properties` dialog you can define a label for the rule. Press the |browsebutton|
button to open the Expression builder. In the **Function List**, click on
:guilabel:`Fields and Values` to view all attributes of the attribute table to
be searched. To add an attribute to the Field calculator **Expression** field,
double click its name in the :guilabel:`Fields and Values` list. Generally you
can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation
expression or you can just type it into the box (see :ref:`vector_field_calculator`).

**Point displacement**

The point displacement renderer offers to visualize all features of a point layer,
even if they have the same location. To do this, the symbols of the points are
placed on a displacement circle around a center symbol.

.. tip:: **Export vector symbology**
   
   You have the possibility to export vector symbology from QGIS into the Google *.kml, *.dxf
   and MapInfo*.tab files. Just open the right mouse menu of the layer and click on :menuselection:`Save selection
   as -->` to define the name of the output file and its format.
   Use the :guilabel:`Symbology export` menu to save the symbology either as
   :menuselection:`Feature symbology -->` or as :menuselection:`Symbol layer symbology -->`. 
   If you have used symbol layers it is recommended to use the second setting.

.. _vector_labels_tab:

Labels Menu
-----------
The |mActionLabeling| :sup:`Labels` core application provides smart
labeling for vector point, line and polygon layers and only requires a
few parameters. This new application also supports on-the-fly transformated layers.
The core functions of the application have been redesigned. In QGIS 2.0.0. 
there are now a number of other features which improve the labeling. The following menus
have been created for labeling the vector layers:

* Text
* Formatting
* Buffer
* Background
* Shadow
* Placement
* Rendering

Let us see how the new menus can be used for various vector layers.

.. _labeling_point_layers:

**Labeling point layers**

Start QGIS and load a vector point layer. Activate the layer in the legend and click on the 
|mActionLabeling| :sup:`Layer Labeling Options` icon in the QGIS toolbar menu.

First step is to activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Label this layer with` checkbox
and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click |mActionmIconExpressionEditorOpen| if you
want to define labels based on expressions.

The following steps describe a simple labeling without using the :guilabel:`Data defined override` functions
that are situated next to the drop-down menus.

You can define the text style in the :guilabel:`Text` menu (see Figure_labels_1_ ). A new function is the
:guilabel:`Type case` option where you can influence the text rendering. You have the possibility to render
the text 'All uppercase', 'All lowercase' or 'Capitalize first letter'. Also, a new function in QGIS 2.0.0
is the use of blend modes (see blend_modes_).

In the :guilabel:`Formatting` menu you can define a character for a line break in the labels with the wrap label on character function.
Use the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Formatted numbers` option to format the numbers in an attribute table. Here 
decimal places are inserted. If you enable this option three decimal places ist set by default. 

To create a buffer just activate |checkbox| :guilabel:`Draw text buffer` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Buffer` menu.
The buffer color is variable. Also, a new function in QGIS 2.0.0 is the user of blend modes (see blend_modes_).
.. FIXME: more information necessary
Use the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Color buffer fill` checkbox to ...

In the :guilabel:`Background` menu you can define with :guilabel:`Size X` and :guilabel:`Size Y` the shape of your background. 
Use :guilabel:`Size type` to insert an additional 'Buffer' into your background. The buffer size one is set by default here.
The background then consists of the buffer plus the background in :guilabel:`Size X` and :guilabel:`Size Y`.
You can set a :guilabel:`Rotation` where you can choose between 'Sync with label', 'Offset of label' and 'Fixed'.
Using 'Offset of label' and 'Fixed' you can rotate the background. Define an :guilabel:`Offset X,Y` with X and Y values and the background 
will be shifted. When applying :guilabel:`Radius X,Y` the background gets rounded corners. 
Again, it is possible to mix the background with the underlying layers in the map canvas using the :guilabel:`Blend mode`
(see blend_modes_).

Use the :guilabel:`Shadow` menu for a user-defined :guilabel:`Drop shadow`. The drawing of the background is very variable. 
Choose between 'Lowest label component', 'Text', 'Buffer' and 'Background'. The :guilabel:`Offset` angle depends on the orientation
of the label. If you choose the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Use global shadow` checkbox then the zero point of the angle is
always oriented to the north and doesn't depend on the orientation of the label. Influence the appearance of the shadow
with the :guilabel:`Blur radius`. The higher the number, the softer the shadows. 
.. FIXME: more information necessary
Using the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Blur only alpha pixels` checkbox the shadow will ...
The appearance of the drop shadow can also be altered by choosing a blend mode (see blend_modes_).

Choose the :guilabel:`Placement` menu for the label placement and the labeling priority. Using the 
|radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Offset from point` setting you now have the possibility to use :guilabel:`Quadrants`
to place your label. Additionally you can alter the angle of the label placement with the :guilabel:`Rotation` setting.
Thus, a placement in a certain quadrant with a certain rotation is possible.

.. index:: Colliding_labels

In the :guilabel:`Rendering` menu you can define label and feature options. In the :guilabel:`Label options` 
you find the scale-based visibility setting now. You can prevent QGIS from rendering only selected labels with
the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Show all labels for this layer (including colliding labels)` checkbox. 
In the :guilabel:`Feature options` you can define if every part of a multipart feature is to be labeled. In QGIS 2.0.0 now it's possible to define 
if the number of features to be labeled is limited and to |checkbox| :guilabel:`Discourage labels from covering features`.

**Labeling line layers**

First step is to activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Label this layer` checkbox
in the :guilabel:`Label settings` tab and select an attribute column to use for
labeling. Click |mActionmIconExpressionEditorOpen| if you
want to define labels based on expressions.

After that you can define the text style in the :guilabel:`Text` menu. Here the
same settings as for point layers are possible.

Also in the :guilabel:`Formatting` menu the same settings as for point layers are possible.

The :guilabel:`Buffer` menu has the same functions as described in section labeling_point_layers_ .

The :guilabel:`Background` menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers_ .

Also the :guilabel:`Shadow` menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers_ .

In the :guilabel:`Placement` menu you find special settings for line layers. The label can be placed
|radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Parallel`, |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Curved` or |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Horizontal`.
With the |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Parallel` and |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Curved` option come the following settings:
You can define the position |checkbox| :guilabel:`Above line`, |checkbox| :guilabel:`On line`
and |checkbox| :guilabel:`Below line`. It's possible to select several options at once. 
QGIS will look for the optimal position of the label then. Remember that here you can 
also use the line orientation for the position of the label. 
.. FIXME: more information necessary
Additionally you can define a :guilabel:`Maximum angle between curved characters` when
selecting the |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Curved` option (see Figure_labels_2_ ).

The :guilabel:`Rendering` menu has nearly the same entries as for point layers. In the
:guilabel:`Feature options` you can now :guilabel:`Suppress labeling of features smaller than`.

**Labeling polygon layers**

First step is to activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Label this layer` checkbox
and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click |mActionmIconExpressionEditorOpen| if you
want to define labels based on expressions.

In :guilabel:`Text` menu define the text style. The entries are the same as for point 
and line layers.

The :guilabel:`Formatting` menu allows you to format multiple lines like for point and line layers.

As with point and line layers you can create a text buffer in the :guilabel:`Buffer` menu.

Use the :guilabel:`Background` menu to create a complex user-defined background for the polygon layer.
You can use the menu as well as for the point and line layers.

The entries in the :guilabel:`Shadow` menu are the same as for point and line layers.

In the :guilabel:`Placement` menu you find special settings for polygon layers (see Figure_labels_3_ ). 
|radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Offset from centroid`, |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Horizontal (slow)`,
|radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Around centroid`, |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Free` and
|radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Using perimeter` are possible.

	In the |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Offset from centroid` settings you can define if the centroid
	is |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`visible polygon` or |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`whole polygon`.
	That means that either the centroid is used for the polygon you can see on the map or the centroid is
	used for the whole polygon, no matter if you can see the whole feature on the map.
	You can place your label with the quadrants here and define offset and rotation.
	The |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Around centroid` setting makes it possible to place the label
	around the centroid with a certain distance. Again, you can define |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`visible polygon` 
	or |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`whole polygon` for the centroid.
	With the |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Using perimeter` settings you can define a position and
	a distance for the label. For the position |checkbox| :guilabel:`Above line`, |checkbox| :guilabel:`On line`,
	|checkbox| :guilabel:`Below line` and |checkbox| :guilabel:`Line orientation dependend position` are possible.

The entries in the :guilabel:`Rendering` menu are the same as for line layers. You can also use
:guilabel:`Suppress labeling of features smaller than` in the :guilabel:`Feature options`.

**Using data-defined override for labeling**

With the data-defined override functions the settings for the labeling
are overwritten by entries in the attribute table.
You can activate/deactivate the function with the right-mouse button.
Hover over the symbol and you see the information about the data-defined override,
including the current definition field.
We now describe an example how to use the data-defined override function for the 
|mActionMoveLabel|:sup:`Move label` function (see figure_labels_4_ ).

#. Import the lakes.shp from the QGIS sample dataset.
#. Double-klick the layer to open the Layer Properties. Klick on :guilabel:`Labels`
   and :guilabel:`Placement`. Select |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Offset from centroid`.
#. Look for the :guilabel:`Data defined` entries. Klick the |mIconDataDefine| -Icon to
   define the field type for the :guilabel:`Coordinate`. Choose 'xlabel' for X and 'ylabel'
   for Y. The Icons are now highlighted in yellow.
#. Zoom into a lake. 
#. Go to the Label toolbar and klick the |mActionMoveLabel| Icon. Now you can shift the label
   manually to another position (see figure_labels_5_ ). The new position of the label is saved in the 'xlabel' and 'ylabel' columns of the 
   attribute table.

Labels (deprecated)
...................

Use of the deprecated labelling engine available in QGIS <= 1.8 is now discouraged, but has not been removed. This is to allow users to migrate existing projects from the old to new labelling engine. The following guidelines for working with the older engine in QGIS 2.0 apply:

* Deprecated labelling tab is removed from vector layer properties dialog for new projects or older opened projects that don't use that labelling engine. 
* Deprecated tab remains active for older opened projects, if any layer uses them, and does not go away even if saving the project with no layers having the older labelling engine enabled.

**NOTE**: There is a very high likelihood the deprecated labelling engine will be completely removed prior to the next stable release of QGIS. Please migrate older projects.

We will illustrate how it works by labeling the lakes shapefile of the QGIS sample dataset:

#. Load the Shapefile :file:`alaska.shp` and GML file :file:`lakes.gml`
   in |qg|
#. Zoom in a bit to your favorite area with some lake
#. Make the 'lakes' layer active
#. Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog
#. In the :guilabel:`Layers (deprecated)` menu click on the :guilabel:`Label Properties` tab.
#. Check the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Display labels` checkbox to enable labeling
#. Choose the field to label with. We will use
   :guilabel:`Field containing label` |selectstring| 'NAMES'
#. Enter a :guilabel:`Default label` for lakes that have no name. The default label will be
   used each time |qg| encounters a lake with no value in the 'NAMES' field.
#. If you have labels extending over several lines, check
   |checkbox|:guilabel:`Multiline labels?`. |qg| will check for a true line
   return in your label field and insert the line breaks accordingly.
   A true line return is a **single** character ``\n``, (not two separate
   characters, like a backlash ``\`` followed by the character ``n``).  To insert
   line returns in an attribute field configure the edit widget to be text
   edit (not line edit).
#. Click **[Apply]**.

Now we have labels. How do they look? They are probably too big and poorly
placed in relation to the marker symbol for the lakes.

Select the :guilabel:`Font size` |selectstring| and use the **[Font]** and **[Color]** buttons to
set the font and color. Define if your labels should be rendered in points or in map units.
You can also change the placement of the text-label.

To change the position of the text relative to the feature:

#. Beneath the Basic label options change the placement by selecting one of the
   radio buttons in the :guilabel:`Placement` group. To fix our labels, choose
   the |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Right` radio button.
#. Click **[Apply]** to see your changes without closing the dialog.

Things are looking better, but the labels are still too close to the marker.
To fix this we can use the options on the ``Offset`` entry which is on the bottom
of the menu. Here we can add offsets for the X and Y directions. Adding an X
offset of 5 will move our labels off the marker and make them more readable. Of
course if your marker symbol or font is larger, more of an offset will be required.

The last adjustment we'll make is to 'Buffer' the labels. This just means
putting a backdrop around them to make them stand out better. To buffer the
lakes labels:

#. Click the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Buffer Labels` checkbox to enable
   buffering.
#. Choose a size for the buffer using the spin box |selectnumber|.
#. The :guilabel:`Buffer size` menu also allows you to select between
   'In Points' or 'In Map units'.
#. Choose a color by clicking on **[Color]** and choosing your favorite
   from the color selector. You can also set some transparency for the
   buffer if you prefer.
#. Click **[Apply]** to see if you like the changes.

As a last define if the labels should be shifted. Use the :guilabel:`Offset` settings and fill
in the 'X offset' and the 'Y offset' . Again, it is possible to define the :guilabel:`Offset` 'In points'
or in 'In map units'.

If you aren't happy with the results, tweak the settings and then test again by
clicking **[Apply]**.

A buffer of 1 points seems to give a good result. Notice you can also specify
the buffer size in map units if that works out better for you.

The advanced entries inside the :guilabel:`Advanced tab` allow you control
the appearance of the labels using attributes stored in the layer. The
entries beginning with 'Data defined' allow you to set all the parameters
for the labels using fields in the layer.

Note that the :guilabel:`Label Properties` tab provides a 'preview-box' where your
selected label is shown.

**Enabled/Disabled deprecated labelling via Python**

The deprecated labelling tab can also be enabled/disabled for the current project, via Python console commands, e.g.:

:: 

	QgsProject.instance().writeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/Enabled', True | False)
	QgsProject.instance().removeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/')

   Dialog to select an edit widget for an attribute column |nix|

Within the :guilabel:`Fields` menu you also find an **edit widget** column.
This column can be used to define values or a range of values that are allowed
to be added to the specific attribute table column. If you click on the
**[edit widget]** button, a dialog opens, where you can define different
widgets. These widgets are:

* **Line edit**: an edit field which allows to enter simple text
  (or restrict to numbers for numeric attributes).
* **Classification**: Displays a combo box with the values used for
  classification, if you have chosen 'unique value' as legend type in
  the :guilabel:`Style` tab of the properties dialog.
* **Range**: Allows to set numeric values from a specific range. The edit
  widget can be either a slider or a spin box.
* **Unique values**: The user can select one of the values already used in
  the attribute table. If editable is activated, a line edit is shown with
  autocompletion support, otherwise a combo box is used.
* **File name**: Simplifies the selection by adding a file chooser dialog.
* **Value map**: a combo box with predefined items. The value is stored in
  the attribute, the description is shown in the combo box. You can define
  values manually or load them from a layer or a CSV file.
* **Enumeration**: Opens a combo box with values that can be used within
  the columns type. This is currently only supported by the postgres provider.
* **Immutable**: The immutable attribute column is read-only. The user is not
  able to modify the content.
* **Hidden**: A hidden attribute column is invisible. The user is not able
  to see its content.
* **Checkbox**: Displays a checkbox and you can define what attribute is
  added to the column when the checkbox is activated or not.
* **Text edit**: This opens a text edit field that allows multiple lines to
  be used.
* **Calendar**: Opens a calendar widget to enter a date. Column type must be
  text.
* **Value Relation**: Offers values from a related table in a combobox. You can
  select layer, key column and value column.
* **UUID Generator**: Generates a read-only UUID (Universally Unique Identifiers)
  field, if empty.
* **Photo**: Field contains a filename for a picture. The width and height of the field can be defined.
* **Webview**: Field contains an URL. The width and height of the field is variable.
* **Color**: A field which allows to enter color codes. During data entry the color is visible through a color bar
  included in the field.

With the **Attribute editor layout** you can now define builtin forms for data entry jobs (see figure_fields_2_).
Choose 'Drag and drop designer' and an attribute column. Use the |mActionSignPlus| Icon to create
a category that then will be shown during the digitizing session (see figure_fields_3_). Next step will be to
assign the relevant fields to the category with the |mActionArrowRight| Icon. You can create
more categories and use the same fields again. When creating a new category QGIS
will insert a new tab for the category in the built in form.

Other options in the dialog are 'Autogenerate' and 'Provide ui-file'. 'Autogenerate' just creates Editors for all fields
and tabulates them.
The 'Provide ui-file' option allows you to use complex dialogs made with the Qt-Designer. Using an UI-file allows
a large freedom in creating a dialog. For detailed information see http://nathanw.net/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/ .

QGIS dialogs can have a python function that is called when the dialog is opened. Use this function to add extra logic to your dialogs.
An example is (in module MyForms.py):

::

  def open(dialog,layer,feature):
  geom = feature.geometry()
  control = dialog.findChild(QWidged,"My line edit")

Reference in Python Init Function like so: MyForms.open

MyForms.py must live on PYTHONPATH, .qgis/python, or inside the project folder

Actions Menu
------------

|action| |qg| provides the ability to perform an action based on the attributes
of a feature. This can be used to perform any number of actions, for example,
running a program with arguments built from the attributes of a feature or
passing parameters to a web reporting tool.

.. _figure_actions_1:

   Overview action dialog with some sample actions |nix|

Actions are useful when you frequently want to run an external application or
view a web page based on one or more values in your vector layer. They are
devided into 6 types and can be used like this:

* Generic, Mac, Windows and Unix actions start an external process,
* Python actions execute a python expression,
* Generic and Python actions are visible everywhere,
* Mac, Windows and Unix actions are visible only on the respective platform (i.e.
  you can define three 'Edit' actions to open an editor and the users can only
  see and execute the one 'Edit' action for their platform to run the editor).

There are several examples included in the dialog. You can load them clicking
on **[Add default actions]**. An example is performing a search based on an
attribute value. This concept is used in the following discussion.

.. index:: Actions, Attribute_Actions

**Defining Actions**

Attribute actions are defined from the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties`
dialog. To :index:`define an action`, open the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties`
dialog and click on the :guilabel:`Actions` menu. Go to the :guilabel:`Action properties`.
Select 'Generic' as type and provide a descriptive name for the action. The action itself must contain
the name of the application that will be executed when the action is invoked.
You can add one or more attribute field values as arguments to the application.
When the action is invoked any set of characters that start with a ``%``
followed by the name of a field will be replaced by the value of that field.
The special characters :index:`%%` will be replaced by the value of the field
that was selected from the identify results or attribute table (see using_actions_
below). Double quote marks can be used to group text into a single argument to
the program, script or command. Double quotes will be ignored if preceded by a
backslash.

If you have field names that are substrings of other field names (e.g.,
``col1`` and ``col10``) you should indicate so, by surrounding the field name
(and the \% character) with square brackets (e.g., ``[%col10]``). This will
prevent the ``%col10`` field name being mistaken for the ``%col1`` field name
with a ``0`` on the end. The brackets will be removed by |qg| when it
substitutes in the value of the field. If you want the substituted field to be
surrounded by square brackets, use a second set like this: ``[[%col10]]``.

Using the :guilabel:`Identify Features` tool you can open :guilabel:`Identify Results`
dialog. It includes a *(Derived)* item that contains information relevant to the
layer type. The values in this item can be accessed in a similar way to the other
fields by using preceeding the derived field name by ``(Derived).``. For example,
a point layer has an ``X`` and ``Y`` field and the value of these can be used in
the action with ``%(Derived).X`` and ``%(Derived).Y``. The derived attributes
are only available from the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog box, not the
:guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog box.

Two :index:`example actions` are shown below:

* ``konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam``
* ``konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%%``

In the first example, the web browser konqueror is invoked and passed a URL
to open. The URL performs a Google search on the value of the ``nam`` field
from our vector layer. Note that the application or script called by the
action must be in the path or you must provide the full path. To be sure, we
could rewrite the first example as:
``/opt/kde3/bin/konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam``. This will
ensure that the konqueror application will be executed when the action is
invoked.

The second example uses the \%\% notation which does not rely on a particular
field for its value. When the action is invoked, the \%\% will be replaced by
the value of the selected field in the identify results or attribute table.

.. _using_actions:

**Using Actions**

Actions can be invoked from either the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog,
an :guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog or from :guilabel:`Run Feature Action`
(recall that these dialogs can be opened by clicking |mActionIdentify|
:sup:`Identify Features` or |mActionOpenTable| :sup:`Open Attribute Table` or
|mAction| :sup:`Run Feature Action`). To invoke an action, right
click on the record and choose the action from the popup menu. Actions are
listed in the popup menu by the name you assigned when defining the actions.
Click on the action you wish to invoke.

If you are invoking an action that uses the ``%%`` notation, right-click on the
field value in the :guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog or the
:guilabel:`Attribute Table` dialog that you wish to pass to the application
or script.

Here is another example that pulls data out of a vector layer and inserts
them into a file using bash and the ``echo`` command (so it will only work
|nix| or perhaps |osx|). The layer in question has fields for a species name
``taxon_name``, latitude ``lat`` and longitude ``long``. I would like to be
able to make a spatial selection of a localities and export these field values
to a text file for the selected record (shown in yellow in the |qg| map area).
Here is the action to achieve this:

::


  bash -c "echo \"%taxon_name %lat %long\" >> /tmp/species_localities.txt"


After selecting a few localities and running the action on each one, opening
the output file will show something like this:

::


  Acacia mearnsii -34.0800000000 150.0800000000
  Acacia mearnsii -34.9000000000 150.1200000000
  Acacia mearnsii -35.2200000000 149.9300000000
  Acacia mearnsii -32.2700000000 150.4100000000


As an exercise we create an action that does a Google search on the ``lakes``
layer. First we need to determine the URL needed to perform a search on a
keyword. This is easily done by just going to Google and doing a simple
search, then grabbing the URL from the address bar in your browser. From this
little effort we see that the format is: http://google.com/search?q=qgis,
where ``QGIS`` is the search term. Armed with this information, we can proceed:

#. Make sure the ``lakes`` layer is loaded.
#. Open the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog by double-clicking on the
   layer in the legend or right-click and choose :guilabel:`Properties`
   from the popup menu.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Actions` menu.
#. Enter a name for the action, for example ``Google Search``.
#. For the action, we need to provide the name of the external program to run.
   In this case, we can use Firefox. If the program is not in your path, you
   need to provide the full path.
#. Following the name of the external application, add the URL used for doing
   a Google search, up to but not included the search term:
   ``http://google.com/search?q=``
#. The text in the :guilabel:`Action` field should now look like this:
   ``firefox http://google.com/search?q=``
#. Click on the drop-down box containing the field names for the ``lakes``
   layer. It's located just to the left of the **[Insert Field]** button.
#. From the drop-down box select 'NAMES' and click **[Insert Field]**.
#. Your action text now looks like this:

   ``firefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES``
#. To finalize the action click the **[Add to action list]** button.


This completes the action and it is ready to use. The final text of the
action should look like this:

::

   firefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES

We can now use the action. Close the :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog and
zoom in to an area of interest. Make sure the ``lakes`` layer is active and
identify a lake. In the result box you'll now see that our action is visible:

   :width: 15em

   Select feature and choose action |nix|

When we click on the action, it brings up Firefox and navigates to the URL
http://www.google.com/search?q=Tustumena. It is also possible to add further
attribute fields to the action. Therefore you can add a ``+`` to the end of
the action text, select another field and click on **[Insert Field]**. In
this example there is just no other field available that would make sense
to search for.

You can define multiple actions for a layer and each will show up in the
:guilabel:`Identify Results` dialog.

.. % FIXME No longer valid??
.. %You can also invoke actions from the attribute table
.. %by selecting a row and right-clicking, then choosing the action from the popup
.. %menu.

You can think of all kinds of uses for actions. For example, if you have
a point layer containing locations of images or photos along with a file name,
you could create an action to launch a viewer to display the image. You could
also use actions to launch web-based reports for an attribute field or
combination of fields, specifying them in the same way we did in our
Google search example.

We can also make more complex examples, for instance on how to use **Python**
actions.

Usually when we create an action to open a file with an external application
we can use absolute paths, or eventually relative paths, in the second case
the path is relative to the location of the external program executable file.
But what about we need to use relative paths, relative to the selected layer
(a file based one, like a shapefile or spatialite)? The following code will
do the trick:

::

  command = "firefox";
  imagerelpath = "images_test/test_image.jpg";
  layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer();
  import os.path;
  layerpath = layer.source() if layer.providerType() == 'ogr' else (qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI(layer.source()).database() if layer.providerType() == 'spatialite' else None);
  path = os.path.dirname(str(layerpath));
  image = os.path.join(path,imagerelpath);
  import subprocess;
  subprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );

we have to just remember that the action is one of type *Python* and to
change the *command* and *imagerelpath* variables to fit our needs.

But what about if the relative path need to be relative to the (saved)
project file? The code of the Python action would be:

::

  command="firefox";
  imagerelpath="images/test_image.jpg";
  projectpath=qgis.core.QgsProject.instance().fileName();
  import os.path; path=os.path.dirname(str(projectpath)) if projectpath != '' else None;
  image=os.path.join(path, imagerelpath);
  import subprocess;
  subprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );

Another Python actions example if the one that allows us to add new layers
to the project. For instance the following examples will add to the project
respectively a vector and a raster. The name of files to be added to the
project and the name to be given to the layer are data driven (*filename* and
*layname* are column names of the table of attributes of the vector where
the action was created):

::


  qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer('/yourpath/[% "filename" %].shp','[% "layername" %]', 'ogr')


To add a raster (a tif image in this example) it becomes:

::


  qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer('/yourpath/[% "filename" %].tif','[% "layername" %]')

.. _`sec_joins`:

Joins Menu
----------


|join| The :guilabel:`Joins` menu allows you to :index:`join` a loaded attribute table
to a loaded vector layer. After clicking |mActionSignPlus| the :guilabel:`Add vector join` dialog appears.
As key columns you have to define a :index:`join layer` you want to connect with the target vector layer , a join field that corresponds to an attribute column in the target layer and a target field you find in the attribute table of the target vector layer here. As a result, all information of the join layer and the target layer are displayed in the attribute table of the target layer as joined information.
 
QGIS currently supports to join non spatial table formats supported by OGR (e.g. CSV, DBF and Excel), delimited text and the PostgreSQL provider (see figure_joins_1_).

Diagrams Menu
-------------

|diagram| The :guilabel:`Diagrams` tab allows you to add a graphic overlay to a
vector layer (see figure_diagrams_1_).

The current core implementation of diagrams provides support for piecharts, text diagrams
and histograms.

The menu is divided into four tabs now: :guilabel:`Appearance`, :guilabel:`Size`, :guilabel:`Postion` and :guilabel:`Options`.

In the case of the text diagram and piechart text values ​​of different data columns are displayed one below the other with a circle or a box and dividers. In the :guilabel:`Size` tab diagram size is based on a fixed size or on linear scaling according to a classification attribute.
The placement of the diagrams which is done in the :guilabel:`Position` tab interacts with the new labeling, so position
conflicts between diagrams and labels are detected and solved. In addition
to chart positions can be fixed by the users hand.

#. In the :guilabel:`Appearance` tab we choose a light blue as Background color and 
   in the :guilabel:`Size` tab we set a fixed size to 18 mm.
#. In the :guilabel:`Position` tab Placement could be set to AroundPoint.
#. In the diagram we want to display the values of the three columns
   ``T_F_JAN``, ``T_F_JUL`` and ``T_F_MEAN``. First select ``T_F_JAN`` as
   :guilabel:`Attributes` and click the |mActionSignPlus| button, then ``T_F_JUL`` and
   finally ``T_F_MEAN``.
#. Now click **[Apply]** to display the diagram in the |qg| main window.
#. You can now adapt the chart size in the :guilabel:`Size` tab. Deactivate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Fixed size` and set 
   the size of the diagrams on the basis of an Attribute with the **[Find maximum value]** button and the
   :guilabel:`Size` menu. If diagrams appear too small on the screen you can activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Increase
   size of small diagrams` checkbox and define the Minimum size of the diagrams.
#. Change the Attribute Colors by double clicking on the color values in the :guilabel:`Assigned attributes` field.   Figure_diagrams_2_ gives an impression.

Metadata Menu
-------------

|metadata| The :guilabel:`Metadata` menu consists of a :guilabel:`Description`, 
:guilabel:`Attribution`, :guilabel:`MetadataURL` and :guilabel:`Properties` section.

In the :guilabel:`Properties` section you get general information about the layer,
including specifics about the type and location, number of features, feature type, 
and the editing capabilities in the :guilabel:`Properties` section. The :guilabel:`Extents`
table provides you with layer extent information, and the :guilabel:`Layer Spatial Reference System`
information, providing information about the CRS of the layer. This is a quick way
to get information about the layer.

Additionally you can add/edit a title for the layer and some abstract information in the :guilabel:`Description`.
Also, it's possible to define a :guilabel:`Keyword list` here. These keyword lists can be used in a 
metadata catalogue. If you want to use a title from an XML metadata file you have to fill in 
a link in the :guilabel:`DataUrl` field.
Use :guilabel:`Attribution` to get Atrribute data from an XML metadata catalogue.
In :guilabel:`MetadataUrl` you can define the general path to the XML metadata catalogue.
These information will be saved in the QGIS project file for following sessions
and will be used for QGIS server.
