The Label Item
===============

To add a label, click the |mActionLabel| :sup:`Add label` icon, place the element
with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas and position and customize
its appearance in the label :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab.

The :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab of a label item provides the following functionality 
for the label item (see Figure_composer_label_):

.. _Figure_composer_label:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Composer Label:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/print_composer/label_mainproperties.png
   :align: center

Main properties
----------------

* The main properties dialog is where the text (HTML or not) or the expression 
  needed to fill the label is added to the Composer canvas.
* Labels can be interpreted as HTML code: check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Render as HTML`. 
  You can now insert a URL, a clickable image that links to a web page or something more complex.
* You can also insert an expression. Click on **[Insert an expression]** to open a new dialog. 
  Build an expression by clicking the functions available in the left side of the panel. 
  Two special categories can be useful, particularly associated with the atlas functionality: 
  geometry functions and records functions. At the bottom, a preview of the expression is shown.

Appearance
----------

* Define :guilabel:`Font` by clicking on the **[Font...]** button or a :guilabel:`Font color` 
  selecting a color using the color selection tool.
* You can specify different horizontal and vertical margins in mm.
  This is the margin from the edge of the composer item. The label can be positioned outside 
  the bounds of the label e.g. to align label items with other items. In this case you have to
  use negative values for the margin. 
* Using the :guilabel:`Alignment` is another way to position your label. Note that when e.g. using
  the :guilabel:`Horizontal alignment` in |radiobuttonon|:guilabel:`Center` Position the 
  :guilabel:`Horizontal margin` feature is disabled.
