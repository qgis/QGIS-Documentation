      :local:

To add an arrow, click the |addArrow| :sup:`Add Arrow` icon, place the element holding
down the left mouse button and drag a line to draw the arrow on the Print Composer canvas and
position and customize the appearance in the scale bar :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab.

When you also hold down the :kbd:`Shift` key while placing the arrow, it is placed in an angle
of exactly 45\ |degrees| .

The arrow item can be used to add a line or a simple arrow that can be used, for example, to
show the relation between other print composer items. To create a north arrow, the image item should
be considered first. QGIS has a set of North arrows in SVG format. Furthermore you can connect
an image item with a map so it can rotate automatically with the map (see :ref:`image_item`).

Item Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Arrow` item properties tab allows you to configure an arrow item.

The  **[Line style ...]** button can be used to set the line style using the line style symbol editor.

In :guilabel:`Arrows markers` you can select one of three radio buttons.

* :guilabel:`None`: To draw a line without arrow head
* :guilabel:`SVG Marker`: To draw a line with an SVG :guilabel:`Start marker` and/or :guilabel:`End marker`

For :guilabel:`Default` Arrow marker you can use following options to style the arrow head.

* :guilabel:`Arrow outline color`: Set the outline color of the arrow head
* :guilabel:`Arrow fill color`: Set the fill color of the arrow head
* :guilabel:`Arrow outline width`: Set the outline width of the arrow head
* :guilabel:`Arrow head width`: Set the size of the arrow head

For :guilabel:`SVG Marker` you can use following options.

* :guilabel:`Start marker`: Choose an SVG image to draw at the beginning of the line
* :guilabel:`End marker`: Choose an SVG image to draw at the end of the line
* :guilabel:`Arrow head width`: Set the size of Start and/or End marker

SVG images are automatically rotated with the line. The color of the SVG image can not be changed.

   Shape Item properties Tab |nix|

The :guilabel:`Shape` item properties tab allows you to select if you want to draw an ellipse,
rectangle or triangle inside the given frame.

You can set the style of the shape using the advanced symbol style dialog with which you can
define its outline and fill color, fill pattern, use markers etcetera.

For the rectangle shape, you can set the value of the corner radius to round of the corners.

.. note::
   Unlike other items, you can not style the frame or the background color of the frame.

The Node-Based Shape Items
--------------------------

To add a node-based shape (polygon or polyline), click the
|addNodesShape| :sup:`Add nodes item` icon. Then perform a left click to
add a node to your current shape. When you're done, a simple right click
terminates the shape. Customize the appareance in the :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab.

   Nodes Shape Item properties Tab

You can set the style of the shape using the advanced symbol style dialog
available thanks to the **[Change ...]** button in :guilabel:`Main properties`.

A specific tool is provided to edit node-based shapes through
|editNodesShape| :sup:`Edit Nodes Item`. Within this mode, you can select
a node by clicking on it (a marker is displayed on the selected node). A
selected node can be moved either by draging it or by using the arrow keys.
Moreover, in this mode, you are able to add nodes to an existing shape. You
just have to do a left click near a segment and if you are not too far from the
shape, a node is added. Finally, you can remove the currently selected node by
hiting the **DEL** key.
