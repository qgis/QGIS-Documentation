The :guilabel:`Shape` item properties tab allows you to select if you want to draw an ellipse,

You can set the style of the shape using the advanced symbol style dialog with which you can 
define its outline and fill color, fill pattern, use markers etcetera.

For the rectangle shape, you can set the value of the corner radius to round of the corners.
