**************
Print Composer
**************

The print composer provides growing layout and printing capabilities. It allows
you to add elements such as the QGIS map canvas, legend, scalebar, images, basic
shapes, arrows and text labels. You can size, group, align and position each
element and adjust the properties to create your layout. The layout can be printed
or exported to image formats, Postscript, PDF or to SVG (export to SVG is not
working properly with some recent Qt4 versions. You should try and check
individual on your system). You can save the layout as template and load it again
in another session. See a list of tools in table_composer_1_:

Table Composer 1: Print Composer Tools

All Print Composer tools are available in menus and as icons in a toolbar. The
toolbar can be switched off and on using the right mouse button holding the mouse
over the toolbar.

.. index::
   single:Composer_Template
.. index::
   single:Map_Template

Open a new Print Composer Template
==================================

Before you start to work with the print composer, you need to load some raster
and vector layers in the QGIS map canvas and adapt their properties to suite your
own convenience. After everything is rendered and symbolized to your liking you
click the |mActionNewComposer| :sup:`New Print Composer` icon in the toolbar or
choose :menuselection:`File --> New Print Composer`.

Using Print Composer
====================

Opening the print composer provides you with a blank canvas to which you can add
the current QGIS map canvas, legend, scalebar, images, basic shapes, arrows and
text. Figure_composer_1_ shows the initial view of the print composer with an
activated |checkbox| :guilabel:`Snap to grid` mode but before any elements are
added.

.. _Figure_composer_1:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Composer 1:**

   :width: 30em

   Print Composer |nix|

The print composer provides four tabs:

* The :guilabel:`Composition` tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the
  print quality for the output file in dpi and to activate snapping to a grid of
  a defined resolution. You can also choose the :guilabel:`Number of pages` your composition will have.
  Please note, the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Snap to grid`
  feature only works, if you define a grid resolution > 0. Furthermore you can
  also activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Print as raster` checkbox. This means
  all elements will be rastered before printing or saving as Postscript or PDF.
* The :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab displays the properties for the selected
  map element. Click the |mActionSelectPan| :sup:`Select/Move item` icon to select
  an element (e.g. legend, scalebar or label) on the canvas. Then click the
  :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab and customize the settings for the selected
  element.
* The :guilabel:`Command history` tab (hidden by default) displays a history of all changes applied
  to the print composer layout. With a mouse click it is possible to undo and
  redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.
* The :guilabel:`Atlas generation` tab allows to enable the generation of an
  atlas for the current composer and gives access to its parameters.

You can add multiple elements to the composer. It is also possible to have more
than one map view or legend or scalebar in the print composer canvas, on one or 
several pages. Each element has its own properties and in the case of the map, 
its own extent. If you want to remove any elements from the composer canvas you 
can do that with the :kbd:`Delete` or the :kbd:`Backspace` key.

Composition tab --- General composition setup
=============================================

In the :guilabel:`Composition` tab, you can define the global settings of your composition.

* You can choose one of the :guilabel:`Presets` for your papersheet, or enter your custom :guilabel:`width` and :guilabel:`height`.
* Composition can now be parted on several pages. For instance, a first page can show a map canvas and a second 
  page will show the attribute table associated to a layer. Set the :guilabel:`Number of pages` to the desired value. 
* Choose the page :guilabel:`Orientation` and its :guilabel:`Exported resolution`
* When checked, the |checkbox| :guilabel:`print as raster` means all elements will be rastered before printing or saving as Postscript or PDF. 
* :guilabel:`Snap to grid` and :guilabel:`Snap to alignements` tools make accomplishing some tasks much easier. There's three types of grid : 
  **Dots**, **Solid** lines and **Crosses**. You can adjust :guilabel:`spacings`, :guilabel:`offsets` and :guilabel:`color` to your need.
* :guilabel:`Selection tolerance` defines the maximum distance below which an item is snapped to the grid.
* :guilabel:`Snap to alignements` shows helping lines when the borders or axis of two items are aligned.

Adding a current QGIS map canvas to the Print Composer
======================================================

Click on the |mActionAddMap| :sup:`Add new map` toolbar button in the print
composer toolbar, to add the QGIS map canvas. Now drag a rectangle on the composer
canvas with the left mouse button to add the map. To display the current map, you
can choose between three different modes in the map :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab:

* **Rectangle** is the default setting. It only displays an empty box with a
  message 'Map will be printed here'.
* **Cache** renders the map in the current screen resolution. If case you zoom
  in or out the composer window, the map is not rendered again but the image will
  be scaled.
* **Render** means, that if you zoom in or out the composer window, the map will
  be rendered again, but for space reasons, only up to a maximum resolution.

**Cache** is default preview mode for newly added print composer maps.

You can resize the map element by clicking on the |mActionSelectPan|
:sup:`Select/Move item` button, selecting the element, and dragging one of the
blue handles in the corner of the map. With the map selected, you can now adapt
more properties in the map :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab.

To move layers within the map element select the map element, click the
|mActionMoveItemContent| :sup:`Move item content` icon and move the layers within
the map element frame with the left mouse button. After you found the right place
for an element, you can lock the element position within the print composer
canvas. Select the map element and click on the right mouse button to |mIconLock|
:sup:`Lock` the element position and again to unlock the element. You can lock
the map element also activating the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Lock layers for map
item` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Map` dialog of the :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab.

.. note::
   QGIS is now able to show labels from the new labeling plugin also in the map
   composer, but it is not yet scaled correctly. So it might be necessary to
   switch back to the standard labeling in some cases.

Map item properties tab --- Map and Extents dialog

Atlas generation
================

The print composer includes generation functions that allow to create map books
in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains
geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output
will be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to
highlight the current geometry. Fields associated to this geometry can be used
within text labels.

There can only be one atlas map by print composer. To enable the generation
of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the `Atlas generation`
tab. This tab contains the following widgets (see Figure_composer_15_):

.. _figure_composer_15:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Composer 15:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer_atlas.png
   :align: center
   :width: 20em

   Atlas generation tab |nix|

* A combobox :guilabel:`Composer map to use` |selectstring| that allows to choose
  which map item will be used as the atlas map, i.e. on which map geometries from
  the coverage layer will be iterated over and displayed.
* A combobox :guilabel:`Coverage layer` |selectstring| that allows to choose the
  (vector) layer containing the geometries on which to iterate over.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Hidden coverage layer`, that if checked, will
  hide the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Sort features` that, if checked, allows to
  sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combobox allows to choose
  which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either ascending or
  descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or a down arrow.
* An optional :guilabel:`Feature filter` text area that allows to specify an
  expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression
  is not empty, only features that evaluate to ``True`` will be selected. The
  button on the right allows to display the expression builder.
* An input box :guilabel:`Margin around coverage` that allows to select the amount
  of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. Its value is
  meaningful only when using the autoscaling mode.
* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Fixed scale` that allows to toggle between auto-scale
  and fixed-scale mode. In fixed scale mode, the map will only be translated for
  each geometry to be centered. In auto-scale mode, the map's extents are computed
  in such a way that each geometry will appear in its whole.
* An :guilabel:`Output filename expression` textbox that is used to generate a
  filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field is
  meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.
* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` that allows to force
  the generation of a single file if this is possible by the chosen output format
  (PDF for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the
  :guilabel:`Output filename expression` field is meaningless.

Generation
----------

The atlas generation is done when the user asks for a print or an export. The
behaviour of these functions will be slightly changed if an atlas map has been
selected.

For instance, when the user asks for an export to PDF, if an atlas map is defined,
the user will be asked for a directory where to save all the generated PDF files
(except if the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` has been
selected).

Navigation tools
================

For map navigation the print composer provides 4 general tools:

* |mActionZoomIn| :sup:`Zoom in`
* |mActionZoomOut| :sup:`Zoom out`
* |mActionZoomFullExtent| :sup:`Zoom to full extend`
* |mActionDraw| :sup:`Refresh the view` (if you find the view in an inconsistent
  state)

.. index:: Revert_Layout_Actions

Revert and Restore tools
========================

During the layout process it is possible to revert and restore changes. This can
be done with the revert and restore tools:

* |mActionUndo| :sup:`Revert last changes`
* |mActionRedo| :sup:`Restore last changes`

or by mouse click within the :guilabel:`Command history` tab (see figure_composer_9_).

Add Basic shape and Arrow
=========================

It is possible to add basic shapes (Ellipse, Rectangle, Triangle) and arrows
to the print composer canvas.

The :guilabel:`Shape` dialog allows to draw an ellipse, rectangle, or triangle
in the print composer canvas. You can define its outline and fill color, the
outline width and a clockwise rotation.

The :guilabel:`Arrow` dialog allows to draw an arrow in the print composer canvas.
You can define color, outline and arrow width and it is possible to use a default
marker and no marker and a SVG marker. For the SVG marker you can additionally
add a SVG start and end marker from a directory on your computer.

Add attribute table values
==========================

It is possible to add parts of a vector attribute table to the print composer
canvas.

**Table dialog**

The :guilabel:`Table` dialog of the attribute table item tab provides following
functionalities (see figure_composer_20_):

   Table Dialog |nix|

* The :guilabel:`Table` dialog allows to select the vector layer and columns of
  the attribute table. Attribute columns can be sorted and you can define to show
  its values ascending or descending.
* You can define the maximum number of rows to be displayed and if attributes are
  only shown for visible features of the current composer canvas.
* Additionally you can define the grid characteristics of the table and the header
  and content font.

**General options dialog**

The :guilabel:`General options` dialog of the attribute table item tab provides
following functionalities (see figure_composer_21_):

   General Options Dialog |nix|

* Here you can define color and outline width for the element frame, set a
  background color and opacity for the table. The **[Position and size]** button
  opens the :guilabel:`Set item position` dialog and allows to set the map canvas
  position using reference points or coordinates. Furthermore you can select or
  unselect to display the element frame with the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Show frame`
  checkbox. Use the Item ID to create a relationship to the other print composer\
  items.

Raise, lower and align elements
===============================

Raise or lower functionalities for elements are inside the |mActionRaiseItems|
:sup:`Raise selected items` pulldown menu. Choose an element on the print composer
canvas and select the matching functionality to raise or lower the selected
element compared to the other elements (see table_composer_1_).

There are several alignment functionalities available within the |mActionAlignLeft|
:sup:`Align selected items` pulldown menu (see table_composer_1_). To use an
alignment functionality , you first select some elements and then click on the
matching alignment icon. All selected will then be aligned within to their common
bounding box.

   single:Printing; Export_Map

Creating Output
===============

Figure_composer_22_ shows the print composer with an example print layout
including each type of map element described in the sections above.

.. index:: Export_as_image, Export_as_PDF, Export_as_SVG

The print composer allows you to create several output formats and it is possible
to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:

* The |mActionFilePrint| :sup:`Print` icon allows to print the layout to a
  connected printer or a Postscript file depending on installed printer drivers.
* The |mActionSaveMapAsImage| :sup:`Export as image` icon exports the composer
  canvas in several image formats such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...
* The |mActionSaveAsPDF| :sup:`Export as PDF` saves the defined print composer
  canvas directly as a PDF.
* The |mActionSaveAsSVG| :sup:`Export as SVG` icon saves the print composer canvas
  as a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).

.. note::

   Currently the SVG output is very basic. This is not a QGIS problem, but a
   problem of the underlaying Qt library. This will hopefully be sorted out in
   future versions.

.. index:: Composer_Manager

Saving and loading a print composer layout
==========================================

With the |mActionFileSaveAs| :sup:`Save as template` and |mActionFolder|
:sup:`Load from template` icons you can save the current state of a print composer
session as a  :file:`.qpt` template and load the template again in another session.

The  |mActionComposerManager| :sup:`Composer Manager` button in the QGIS toolbar
and in :menuselection:`File --> Composer Manager` allows to add a new composer
template or to manage already existing templates.
