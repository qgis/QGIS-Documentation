**************
Print Composer
**************

The print composer provides growing layout and printing capabilities. It allows
you to add elements such as the QGIS map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scalebars, basic
shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. You can size, group, align and position each
element and adjust the properties to create your layout. The layout can be printed
or exported to image formats, Postscript, PDF or to SVG (export to SVG is not
working properly with some recent Qt4 versions, you should try and check
individual on your system). You can save the layout as template and load it again
in another session. Finally, generating several maps based on a template can be done throught the Atlas generator

Table Composer 1: Print Composer Tools

All Print Composer tools are available in menus and as icons in a toolbar. The
toolbar can be switched off and on using the right mouse button over the toolbar.

.. index::
   single:Composer_Template
.. index::
   single:Map_Template

Open a new Print Composer Template
==================================

Before you start to work with the print composer, you need to load some raster
and vector layers in the QGIS map canvas and adapt their properties to suit your
own convenience. After everything is rendered and symbolized to your liking,
click the |mActionNewComposer| :sup:`New Print Composer` icon in the toolbar or
choose :menuselection:`File --> New Print Composer`.

Using Print Composer
====================

Opening the print composer provides you with a blank canvas to which you can add
the current QGIS map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scalebars, basic
shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. Figure_composer_1_ shows the initial view of the print composer with an
activated |checkbox| :guilabel:`Snap to grid` mode but before any elements are
added.

.. _Figure_composer_1:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Composer 1:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer_blank.png

   :width: 30em

   Print Composer |nix|

The print composer provides four tabs:

* The :guilabel:`Composition` tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the
  print quality for the output file in dpi and to activate snapping to a grid of
  a defined resolution. You can also choose the :guilabel:`Number of pages` your composition will have.
  Please note, the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Snap to grid`
  feature only works, if you define a grid resolution > 0. Furthermore you can
  also activate the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Print as raster` checkbox. This means
  all elements will be rastered before printing or saving as Postscript or PDF.
* The :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab displays the properties for the selected
  item element. Click the |mActionSelectPan| :sup:`Select/Move item` icon to select
  an element (e.g. legend, scalebar or label) on the canvas. Then click the
  :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab and customize the settings for the selected
  element.
* The :guilabel:`Command history` tab (hidden by default) displays a history of all changes applied
  to the print composer layout. With a mouse click it is possible to undo and
  redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.
* The :guilabel:`Atlas generation` tab allows to enable the generation of an
  atlas for the current composer and gives access to its parameters.

You can add multiple elements to the composer. It is also possible to have more
than one map view or legend or scalebar in the print composer canvas, on one or 
several pages. Each element has its own properties and in the case of the map, 
its own extent. If you want to remove any elements from the composer canvas you 
can do that with the :kbd:`Delete` or the :kbd:`Backspace` key.

Navigation tools
----------------

To navigate in the canvas layout, the print composer provides 4 general tools:

* |mActionZoomIn| :sup:`Zoom in`
* |mActionZoomOut| :sup:`Zoom out`
* |mActionZoomFullExtent| :sup:`Zoom to full extend`
* |mActionDraw| :sup:`Refresh the view` (if you find the view in an inconsistent
  state)

Composition tab --- General composition setup
=============================================

In the :guilabel:`Composition` tab, you can define the global settings of your composition.

* You can choose one of the :guilabel:`Presets` for your papersheet, or enter your custom :guilabel:`width` and :guilabel:`height`.
* Composition can now be parted on several pages. For instance, a first page can show a map canvas and a second 
  page will show the attribute table associated to a layer while a third ons shows a HTML frame linking to your organization website. 
  Set the :guilabel:`Number of pages` to the desired value. 
* Choose the page :guilabel:`Orientation` and its :guilabel:`Exported resolution`
* When checked, the |checkbox| :guilabel:`print as raster` means all elements will be rasterized before printing or saving as Postscript or PDF. 
* :guilabel:`Snap to grid` and :guilabel:`Snap to alignements` tools make accomplishing some tasks much easier. There's three types of grid : 
  **Dots**, **Solid** lines and **Crosses**. You can adjust :guilabel:`spacings`, :guilabel:`offsets` and :guilabel:`color` to your need.
* :guilabel:`Selection tolerance` defines the maximum distance below which an item is snapped to the grid.
* :guilabel:`Snap to alignements` shows helping lines when the borders or axis of two items are aligned.

Adding a current QGIS map canvas to the Print Composer
======================================================

Click on the |mActionAddMap| :sup:`Add new map` toolbar button in the print
composer toolbar to add the QGIS map canvas. Now drag a rectangle on the composer
canvas with the left mouse button to add the map. To display the current map, you
can choose between three different modes in the map :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab:

* **Rectangle** is the default setting. It only displays an empty box with a
  message 'Map will be printed here'.
* **Cache** renders the map in the current screen resolution. If case you zoom
  in or out the composer window, the map is not rendered again but the image will
  be scaled.
* **Render** means, that if you zoom in or out the composer window, the map will
  be rendered again, but for space reasons, only up to a maximum resolution.

**Cache** is default preview mode for newly added print composer maps.

You can resize the map element by clicking on the |mActionSelectPan|
:sup:`Select/Move item` button, selecting the element, and dragging one of the
blue handles in the corner of the map. With the map selected, you can now adapt
more properties in the map :guilabel:`Item Properties` tab.

To move layers within the map element select the map element, click the
|mActionMoveItemContent| :sup:`Move item content` icon and move the layers within
the map element frame with the left mouse button. After you found the right place
for an element, you can lock the element position within the print composer
canvas. Select the map element and click on the right mouse button to |mIconLock|
:sup:`Lock` the element position and again to unlock the element. You can lock
the map element also activating the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Lock layers for map
item` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Map` dialog of the :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab.

  map element in the print composer and clicking the **[Update preview]** button.
* The field :guilabel:`Scale` |selectnumber| sets a manual scale.
* The field :guilabel:`Rotation` |selectnumber| allows to
  rotate the map element content clockwise in degrees. Note, a coordinate frame
  can only be added with the default value 0.
* The |checkbox| :guilabel:`Draw map canvas items` lets you show annotations that may be placed on the map canvas in the main QGIS window.
* You can choose to lock the layers shown on a map item. Check the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Lock layers for map item`. Any layer that would be displayed or hidden in the main QGIS window after checked on won't appear or be hidden in the map item of the composer. But style and labels of a locked layer is still refreshed accordingly to the main QGIS interface.

* :guilabel:`Transparency` |slider|: you can make the underlying item in the composer
  visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your item to your needs.
  You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the the menu beside the slider.
* :guilabel:`Blending mode`: you can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you 
  previously only know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying items are mixed
  through the settings described below.

	* Normal: This is the standard blend mode which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the
	  Pixel beneath it; the colors aren't mixed
	* Lighten: It selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged
	  and harsh.
	* Screen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is
 	  most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer. E.g. you can use a hillshade to texture another layer
	* Dodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So brighter top pixels 
          cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top
          pixels aren't too bright, otherwise the effect is too extreme.
	* Addition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above 1 (in the case of RGB), white is
          displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.
	* Darken: Creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the 
	  results tend to be jagged and harsh
	* Multiply: It multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the top layer with the corresponding pixel for the bottom layer.
          The results are darker pictures.
	* Burn: Darker colors in the top layer causes the underlying layers to darken. Can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.
	* Overlay: Combines multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture light parts of the picture become lighter and dark parts become
          darker. 
	* Soft light: Very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This one is supposed to emulate shining a soft
          light onto an image.
	* Hard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It's supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.
	* Difference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel or the other way round, to always get a positive value. Blending with
          black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0.
	* Subtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.

.. index:: Atlas_Generation

****************
Atlas generation
****************

The print composer includes generation functions that allow to create map books
in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains
geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output
will be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to
highlight the current geometry. Fields associated to this geometry can be used
within text labels.

There can only be one atlas map by print composer but this one can contain multiple pages. 
Every pages will be generated  with each feature. To enable the generation
of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the `Atlas generation`
tab. This tab contains the following widgets (see Figure_composer_30_):

.. _figure_composer_30:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Composer 30:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer_atlas.png
   :align: center
   :width: 20em

   Atlas generation tab |nix|

* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Generate an atlas` enables or disables the atlas generation.
* A combobox :guilabel:`Composer map` |selectstring| that allows to choose
  which map item will be used as the atlas map, i.e. on which map geometries from
  the coverage layer will be iterated over and displayed.
* A combobox :guilabel:`Coverage layer` |selectstring| that allows to choose the
  (vector) layer containing the geometries on which to iterate over.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Hidden coverage layer`, that if checked, will
  hide the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Features sorting` that, if checked, allows to
  sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combobox allows to choose
  which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either ascending or
  descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or a down arrow.
* An optional :guilabel:`Feature filtering` text area that allows to specify an
  expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression
  is not empty, only features that evaluate to ``True`` will be selected. The
  button on the right allows to display the expression builder.
* An input box :guilabel:`Scaling` that allows to select the amount
  of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. Its value is
  meaningful only when using the autoscaling mode.
* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Fixed scale` that allows to toggle between auto-scale
  and fixed-scale mode. In fixed scale mode, the map will only be translated for
  each geometry to be centered. In auto-scale mode, the map's extents are computed
  in such a way that each geometry will appear in its whole.
* An :guilabel:`Output filename expression` textbox that is used to generate a
  filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field is
  meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.
* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` that allows to force
  the generation of a single file if this is possible by the chosen output format
  (PDF for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the
  :guilabel:`Output filename expression` field is meaningless.

In order to adapt labels to the feature the atlas plugin iterates over, use a label with this special notation `[%expression using field_name%]`.
For example, with a city layer with fields CITY_NAME and ZIPCODE, you could insert this : 

"`[% 'The area of ' || upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' format_number($area/1000000,2) || ' km2' %]`"

And that would result in the generated atlas as 

"`The area of PARIS,75001 is 1.94 km2`".

Generation
----------

The atlas generation is done when the user asks for a print or an export. The
behaviour of these functions will be slightly changed if an atlas map has been
selected.

For instance, when the user asks for an export to PDF, if an atlas map is defined,
the user will be asked for a directory where to save all the generated PDF files
(except if the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` has been
selected).

.. index:: Export_as_image, Export_as_PDF, Export_as_SVG

The print composer allows you to create several output formats and it is possible
to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:

* The |mActionFilePrint| :sup:`Print` icon allows to print the layout to a
  connected printer or a Postscript file depending on installed printer drivers.
* The |mActionSaveMapAsImage| :sup:`Export as image` icon exports the composer
  canvas in several image formats such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...
* The |mActionSaveAsPDF| :sup:`Export as PDF` saves the defined print composer
  canvas directly as a PDF.
* The |mActionSaveAsSVG| :sup:`Export as SVG` icon saves the print composer canvas
  as a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).

.. note::

   Currently the SVG output is very basic. This is not a QGIS problem, but a
   problem of the underlaying Qt library. This will hopefully be sorted out in
   future versions.
   Export big raster can sometimes fail, even if there seems to be enough memory. 
   This is also a problem of the underlaying Qt management of raster.
