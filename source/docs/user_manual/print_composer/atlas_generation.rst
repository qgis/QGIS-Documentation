Atlas generation
================

The Print Composer includes generation functions that allow you to create map 
books in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains 
geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output will 
be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to highlight the 
current geometry. Fields associated with this geometry can be used within text 
labels.

Every page will be generated with each feature. To enable the generation
of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the `Atlas generation` tab. 
This tab contains the following widgets (see  figure_composer_atlas_1_):

   Atlas generation tab |nix|

* |checkbox| :guilabel:`Generate an atlas`, which enables or disables the atlas 
  generation.
* A :guilabel:`Coverage layer` |selectstring| combo box that allows you to choose
  the   (vector) layer containing the features on which to iterate over.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Hidden coverage layer` that, if checked,
  will hide   the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.
* An optional :guilabel:`Page name` combo box to give a more explicite name to
  each feature page(s) when previewing atlas. You can select an attribute of 
  the coverage layer or set an expression. If this option is empty, QGIS will 
  use an internal ID, according to the filter and/or the sort order applied to 
  the layer.
* An optional :guilabel:`Filter with` text area that allows you to specify an 
  expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression 
  is not empty, only features that evaluate to ``True`` will be selected. 
  The button on the right allows you to display the expression builder.
* An optional |checkbox| :guilabel:`Sort by` that, if checked, allows you to 
  sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combo box allows you to 
  choose which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either 
  ascending or descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or 
  a down arrow.
  
You also have options to set the output of the atlas:

* An :guilabel:`Output filename expression` textbox that is used to generate 
  a filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field 
  is meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.
* A |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` that allows you to 
  force the generation of a single file if this is possible with the chosen output 
  format (PDF, for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the 
  :guilabel:`Output filename expression` field is meaningless.


You can use multiple map items with the atlas generation; each map will be rendered 
according to the coverage features. To enable atlas generation for a specific map 
item, you need to check |checkbox|:guilabel:`Controlled by Atlas` under the item 
properties of the map item.
Once checked, you can set:

* A radiobutton |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Margin around feature` that allows you to select 
  the amount of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. 
  Its value is meaningful only when using the auto-scaling mode.
* A |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Predefined scale` (best fit). It will use the best 
  fitting option from the list of predefined scales in your project properties settings 
  (see :guilabel:`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Project Scales` 
  to configure these predefined scales).
* A |radiobuttonoff| :guilabel:`Fixed scale` that allows you to toggle between 
  auto-scale and fixed-scale mode. 
  In fixed-scale mode, the map will only be translated for each geometry to be centered. 
  In auto-scale mode, the map's extents are computed in such a way that 
  each geometry will appear in its entirety.

Labels
------

In order to adapt labels to the feature the atlas plugin iterates over, you can include expressions.
For example, for a city layer with fields CITY_NAME and ZIPCODE, you could insert this:

.. code::

   The area of [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' 
   format_number($area/1000000,2) %] km2
 
The information `[% upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' format_number($area/1000000,2) %]` 
is an expression used inside the label. That would result in the generated atlas as:

`The area of PARIS,75001 is 1.94 km2`


.. _atlas_data_defined_override:

Data Defined Override Buttons
-----------------------------

There are several places where you can use a |mIconDataDefine| :sup:`Data Defined 
Override` button to override the selected setting. These options are particularly 
useful with Atlas Generation.

For the following examples the `Regions` layer of the |qg| sample dataset is used 
and selected for Atlas Generation.
We also assume the paper format `A4 (210X297)` is selected in the 
:guilabel:`Composition` tab for field :guilabel:`Presets`.

With a `Data Defined Override` button you can dynamically set the paper orientation. 
When the height (north-south) of the extents of a region is greater than its width 
(east-west), you rather want to use `portrait` instead of `landscape` orientation 
to optimize the use of paper.
 
In the :guilabel:`Composition` you can set the field :guilabel:`Orientation` 
and select `Landscape` or `Portrait`. We want to set the orientation dynamically 
using an expression depending on the region geometry. 
Press the |mIconDataDefine| button of field :guilabel:`Orientation`, select 
:menuselection:`Edit...` so the :guilabel:`Expression string builder` dialog opens. 
Give following expression:

.. code::

   CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) 
   THEN 'Landscape' ELSE 'Portrait' END

Now the paper orients itself automatically for each Region you need to reposition 
the location of the composer item as well. For the map item you can 
use the |mIconDataDefine| button of field :guilabel:`Width` to set it 
dynamically using following expression: 

.. code::

   (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) 
   THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) - 20

Use the |mIconDataDefine| button of field :guilabel:`Heigth` to provide following
expression: 

.. code::

   (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) 
   THEN 210 ELSE 297 END) - 20

When you want to give a title above map in the center of the page, 
insert a label item above the map. First use the item properties of the label 
item to set the horizontal alignment to |radiobuttonon| :guilabel:`Center`.
Next activate from :guilabel:`Reference point` the upper middle checkbox.  
You can provide following expression for field :guilabel:`X` :

.. code::

   (CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) 
   THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) / 2

For all other composer items you can set the position in a similar way so they 
are correctly positioned when page is automatically rotated in portrait or 
landscape.

Information provided is derived from the excellent blog (in English and Portugese) 
on the Data Defined Override options Multiple_format_map_series_using_QGIS_2.6_ .

This is just one example of how you can use Data Defined Override option.

   Atlas Preview toolbar |nix|

Once the atlas settings have been configured and composer items (map, table, 
image...) linked to it, you can create a preview of all the pages by clicking 
:menuselection:`Atlas --> Preview Atlas` or |mIconAtlas| :sup:`Preview Atlas` icon. 
You can then use the arrows in the same toolbar to navigate through all the 
features:

* |mActionAtlasFirst| :sup:`First feature`
* |mActionAtlasPrev| :sup:`Previous feature`
* |mActionAtlasNext| :sup:`Next feature`
* |mActionAtlasLast| :sup:`Last feature`

You can also use the combo box to directly select and preview a specific feature. 
The combo box shows atlas features name according to the expression set in the 
atlas :guilabel:`Page name` option. 

Generation
----------

As for simple compositions, an atlas can be generated in different ways (see 
:ref:`create-output` for more information). Instead of :menuselection:`Composer` 
menu, rather use tools from :menuselection:`Atlas` menu or Atlas toolbar.

This means that you can directly print your compositions with :menuselection:`Atlas --> Print Atlas`. 
You can also create a PDF using :menuselection:`Atlas --> Export Atlas as PDF...`: 
The user will be asked for a directory to save all the generated PDF files, 
except if the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Single file export when possible` has been 
selected. In that case, you'll be prompted to give a filename.

With :menuselection:`Atlas --> Export Atlas as Images...` or 
:menuselection:`Atlas --> Export Atlas as SVG...` tool, you're also prompted to
select a folder. Each page of each atlas feature composition is exported to 
an image or SVG file.


.. tip:: **Print a specific atlas feature**
  
  If you want to print or export composition of only one feature of the atlas,
  simply start the preview, select the desired feature in the drop-down list
  and click on :menuselection:`Composer --> Print` (or :menuselection:`export...`
  to any supported file format).
