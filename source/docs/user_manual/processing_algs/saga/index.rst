`SAGA <http://www.saga-gis.org/en.html>`_ (System for Automated
Geoscientific Analyses) is a free, hybrid, cross-platform GIS software. SAGA
provides many geoscientific methods which are bundled in so-called module
libraries.

.. note::
   Please remember that Processing contains only the interface description, so
   you need to install SAGA by yourself and configure Processing properly.
