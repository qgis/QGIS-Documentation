`TauDEM <http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5.html>`_
(Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a set of Digital Elevation
Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information
from topography as represented by a DEM. This is software developed at Utah
State University (USU) for hydrologic digital elevation model analysis and
watershed delineation.

TauDEM is distributed as a set of standalone command line executable programs
for a Windows and source code for compiling and use on other systems.

.. note::
   Please remember that Processing contains only the interface description, so
   you need to install TauDEM 5.0.6 by yourself and configure Processing
   properly.
