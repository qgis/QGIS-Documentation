Parameters
..........

Outputs
.......

``Extracted (location)`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer of the spatial intersection.


.. _qgisrandomextract:

Random extract
--------------
Takes a vector layer and generates a new one that contains only a subset of the
features in the input layer.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.

.. seealso:: :ref:`qgisrandomselection`

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Source vector layer to select the features from.

``Method`` [enumeration]

.. _qgisrandomextractwithinsubsets:

Random extract within subsets
-----------------------------
Takes a vector layer and generates a new one that contains only a subset of the
features in the input layer.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.
The percentage/count value is not applied to the whole layer, but instead to each
category. Categories are defined according to a given attribute.

.. seealso:: :ref:`qgisrandomselectionwithinsubsets`

Parameters
