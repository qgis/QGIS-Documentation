.. _qgisextractbyattribute:

Extract by attribute
--------------------
Creates two vector layers from an input layer: one will contain only matching
features while the second will contain all the non-matching features.

The criteria for adding features to the resulting layer is defined based on the
values of an attribute from the input layer.

Parameters
..........

``Input Layer`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer to extract features from.

``Selection attribute`` [tablefield: any]
  Filtering field of the layer.

``Operator`` [enumeration]
  Many different operators are available:

  * ``=``
  * ``≠``
  * ``>``
  * ``>=``
  * ``<``
  * ``<=``
  * ``begins with``
  * ``contains``
  * ``is null``
  * ``is not null``
  * ``does not contain``

  Default: ``=``

``Value`` [string]
  Optional

  Value to be evaluated.

Outputs
.......

``Extracted (attribute)`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer with matching features.

``Extracted (non-matching)`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer with not matching features.


.. _qgisextractbyexpression:

Extract by expression
---------------------
Creates two vector layers from an input layer: one will contain only matching
features while the second will contain all the non-matching features.

The criteria for adding features to the resulting layer is based on a QGIS expression.

For more information about expressions see the :ref:`vector_expressions`.

Parameters
..........

``Input Layer`` [vector: any]
  Input vector layer.

``Expression`` [expression]
  Expression to filter the vector layer.

Outputs
.......

``Matching features`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer with matching features.

``Non-matching`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer with not matching features.


.. _qgisextractbylocation:

Extract by location
-------------------
Creates a new vector layer that only contains matching features from an input layer.

The criteria for adding features to the resulting layer is defined based on the
spatial relationship between each feature and the features in an additional layer.

Parameters
..........

``Extract features from`` [vector: any]
  Input vector layer.

``Where the features (geometric predicate)`` [enumeration] [list]
  Spatial condition for the selection:

  * intersect
  * contain
  * disjoint
  * equal
  * touch
  * overlap
  * are within
  * cross

``By comparing to the features from`` [vector: any]
  Intersection vector layer.


Output
......

``Extracted (location)`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer of the spatial intersection.


.. _qgisrandomextract:

Random extract
--------------
Takes a vector layer and generates a new one that contains only a subset of the
features in the input layer.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Source vector layer to select the features from.

``Method`` [enumeration]
  Method of the random selection:

  * Number of selected features
  * Percentage of selected features

  Default: *Number of selected features*

``Number/percentage of selected features`` [number]
  Number or the percentage of the features to select.

  Default: *10*

Output
......

``Extracted (random)`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer containing random selected features.


.. _qgisrandomextractwithinsubsets:

Random extract within subsets
-----------------------------
Takes a vector layer and generates a new one that contains only a subset of the
features in the input layer.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.
The percentage/count value is not applied to the whole layer, but instead to each
category. Categories are defined according to a given attribute.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Source vector layer to select the features from.

``ID field`` [tablefield: any]
  Category of the source vector layer to select the features from.

``Method`` [enumeration]
  Method of the random selection:

  * Number of selected features
  * Percentage of selected features

  Default: *Number of selected features*

``Number/percentage of selected features`` [number]
  Number or the percentage of the feature to select.

  Default: *10*

Output
......

``Extracted (random stratified)`` [vector: any]
  Random vector layer.


.. _qgisrandomselection:

Random selection
----------------
Takes a vector layer and selects a subset of its features. No new layer is generated
by this algorithm.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Research Tools`

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Source vector layer to select the features from.

``Method`` [enumeration]
  Method of the random selection:

  * Number of selected features
  * Percentage of selected features

  Default: *Number of selected features*

``Number/percentage of selected features`` [number]
  Number or the percentage of the features to select.

  Default: *10*


.. _qgisrandomselectionwithinsubsets:

Random selection within subsets
-------------------------------
Takes a vector layer and selects a subset of its features. No new layer is generated
by this algorithm.

The subset is defined randomly, based on feature IDs, using a percentage or count
value to define the total number of features in the subset.

The percentage/count value is not applied to the whole layer, but instead to each
category.

Categories are defined according to a given attribute, which is also specified as
an input parameter for the algorithm.

No new outputs are created.
