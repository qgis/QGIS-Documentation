.. _qgisbasicstatisticsforfields:

Basic statistics for fields
---------------------------
Generates basic statistics for a field of the attribute table of a vector layer.

Numeric, date, time and string fields are supported.

The statistics returned will depend on the field type.

Statistics are generated as an HTML file and are available in the
:menuselection:`Processing --> Results viewer`

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........

``Input vector`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer to calculate the statistic on

``Field to calculate statistics on`` [tablefield: any]
  Any supported table field to calculate the statistics

Outputs
.......
``Statistics`` [html]
  HTML file with calculated statistics


.. _qgiscountpointsinpolygon:

Count points in polygon
-----------------------
Takes a point and a polygon layer and counts the number of points from the
first one in each polygon of the second one.

A new polygons layer is generated, with the exact same content as the input polygons
layer, but containing an additional field with the points count corresponding to
each polygon.

.. figure:: img/count_points_polygon.png
  :align: center

  The labels identify the point count

An optional weight field can be used to assign weights to each point. Alternatively,
a unique class field can be specified. If both options are used, the weight field
will take precedence and the unique class field will be ignored.

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........
``Polygons`` [vector: polygon]
  Polygons layer

``Points`` [vector: point]
  Points layer

``Weight field`` [tablefield: any]
  Optional

  The count generated will be the sum of the weight field for each point contained
  by the polygon.

``Class field`` [tablefield: any]
  Optional

  Points are classified based on the selected attribute and if several points with
  the same attribute value are within the polygon, only one of them is counted.
  The final count of the point in a polygon is, therefore, the count of different
  classes that are found in it.

``Count field name`` [string]
  The name of the field to store the count of points

  Default: *NUMPOINTS*

Outputs
.......

``Count`` [vector: polygon]
  Resulting layer with the attribute table containing the new column of the
  points count.

Creates a table containing a distance matrix, with distances between all the points
in a points layer.

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........

``Input unique ID field`` [tablefield: any]
  Define the field of the input layer with unique ID that will be copied in the
  output attribute table.

``Target point layer`` [vector: point]
  Destination point vector layer

``Target unique ID field`` [tablefield: any]
  Define the field of the target layer with unique ID that will be copied in the
  output attribute table.

``Output matrix type`` [selection]

  Default: *Linear (N*k x 3) distance matrix*

``Use only the nearest (k) target points`` [number]
  You can choose to calculate the distance between all points or to stop the
  calculation at a chosen point number.

  Default: *0* all points are used

Outputs
.......

``Distance matrix`` [vector: point]
  Point vector layer with attribute table composed by:

  * *InputID*: the unique ID of the input layer
  * *TargetID*: the unique ID of the target layer
  * *Distance*: the distance between the points

.. _qgishublines:

Join by lines (hub lines)
-------------------------
Creates hub and spoke diagrams by connecting lines from points on the spoke layer
to matching points in the hub layer.

Determination of which hub goes with each point is based on a match between the
Hub ID field on the hub points and the Spoke ID field on the spoke points.

If input layers are not point layers, a point on the surface of the geometries will be taken as the connecting location.
