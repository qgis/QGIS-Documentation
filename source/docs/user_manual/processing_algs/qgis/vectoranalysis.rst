.. _qgisbasicstatisticsforfields:

Basic statistics for fields
---------------------------
Generates basic statistics for a field of the attribute table of a vector layer.

Numeric, date, time and string fields are supported.

The statistics returned will depend on the field type.

Statistics are generated as an HTML file and are available in the
:menuselection:`Processing --> Results viewer`.

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........

``Input vector`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer to calculate the statistic on.

``Field to calculate statistics on`` [tablefield: any]
  Any supported table field to calculate the statistics.

Outputs
.......
``Statistics`` [html]
  HTML file with calculated statistics.


.. _qgisclimbalongline:

Climb along line
----------------

This algorithm calculates the total climb and descent along line geometries.
The input layer must have Z values present. If Z values are not available,
the  "Drape" (set Z value from raster) algorithm may be used to add Z values
from a DEM layer.

The output layer is a copy of the input layer with additional fields that
contain the total climb, total descent, the minimum elevation and the
maximum elevation for each line geometry.
If the input layer contains fields with the same names as these added fields,
they will be renamed (field names will be altered to "name_2", "name_3", etc,
finding the first non-duplicate name).

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........

``Line layer`` [vector: line]
  Line layer to calculate the climb for.

Outputs
.......
``Climb layer`` [vector: line]
  Line layer containing new attributes with the results from climb calculations.

``Total climb``
  The sum of the climb for all the line geometries in the layer.

``Total descent``
  The sum of the descent for all the line geometries in the layer.

``Minimum elevation``
  The minimum elevation for the geometries in the layer.

``Maximum elevation``
  The maximum elevation for the geometries in the layer.


.. _qgiscountpointsinpolygon:

Count points in polygon
-----------------------
Takes a point and a polygon layer and counts the number of points from the
first one in each polygon of the second one.

A new polygons layer is generated, with the exact same content as the input polygons
layer, but containing an additional field with the points count corresponding to
each polygon.

.. figure:: img/count_points_polygon.png
  :align: center

  The labels identify the point count

An optional weight field can be used to assign weights to each point. Alternatively,
a unique class field can be specified. If both options are used, the weight field
will take precedence and the unique class field will be ignored.

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools`

Parameters
..........
``Polygons`` [vector: polygon]
  Polygon layer whose features are associated with the count of points
  they contain.

``Points`` [vector: point]
  Point layer to count features from.

``Weight field`` [tablefield: any]
  Optional

  A field with numeric-like values from the point layer.
  The count generated will be the sum of the weight field for each point contained
  by the polygon.

``Class field`` [tablefield: any]
  Optional

  Points are classified based on the selected attribute and if several points with
  the same attribute value are within the polygon, only one of them is counted.
  The final count of the points in a polygon is, therefore, the count of different
  classes that are found in it.

``Count field name`` [string]
  The name of the field to store the count of points.

  Default: *NUMPOINTS*

Outputs
.......

``Count`` [vector: polygon]
  Resulting layer with the attribute table containing the new column of the
  points count.


.. _qgisdbscanclustering:

  the same cluster.

  Default: *1.0*

``Treat border points as noise (DBSCAN*)`` [boolean]
  Optional

  If checked, points on the border of a cluster are themselves treated as
  unclustered points, and only points on the interior of a cluster are tagged
  as clustered.

  Default: *FALSE*

``Cluster field name`` [string]
  Name of the field where to store the associated cluster number.

  Default: *CLUSTER_ID*

Outputs
.......

``Clusters`` [vector: point]
  Vector layer containing the original features with a field
  setting the cluster they belong to.

    *TargetID* and *Distance*.
  * 1 --- Standard (N x T) distance matrix
  * 2 --- Summary distance matrix (mean, std. dev., min, max): for each input
