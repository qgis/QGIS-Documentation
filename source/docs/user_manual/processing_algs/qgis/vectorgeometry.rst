.. _qgis_aggregate:

Aggregate
---------
Takes a vector or table layer and creates a new layer by aggregating features based
on a ``group by`` expression.

Features for which ``group by`` expression returns the same value are grouped together.

It is possible to group all source features together using constant value in ``group
by`` parameter, example: NULL.

It is also possible to group features using multiple fields using Array function,
example: Array("Field1", "Field2").

Geometries (if present) are combined into one multipart geometry for each group.
Output attributes are computed depending on each given aggregate definition.

This algorithm allows to use the default aggregation functions of the QGIS Expression
engine.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer in input to aggregate the features from

``Group by expression`` [tablefield: any]
  Choose the grouping field. If *NULL* all features will be grouped

  Default: *NULL*

``Aggregates`` [fieldsmapping]
  Summary of all fields of the source layer, aggregation function available,
  delimiter and output field name

``Load fields from layer`` [vector: any]
  You can also load the fields from another layer and use these fields for the
  aggregation.

Output
......

``Aggregated`` [vector]
  Multigeometry vector layer with the aggregated values

........
For a  complete description of the aggregates function, refer to the dedicated
:ref:`aggregates_function` chapter.


.. _qgis_boundary:

the topological boundary of the geometry).

Only valid for polygon or line layers.

For **polygon geometries** , the boundary consists of all the line strings for
each ring of the polygon.

.. _qgis_buffer:

Buffer
------
Computes a buffer area for all the features in an input layer, using a fixed distance.

It is possible to define also a negative distance for polygon input layers: in this
case the buffer will result in a smaller polygon.

Buffer always results in a polygon layer: in the following picture the buffer
for points, lines and polygons:

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/buffer.png
   :align: center

   In yellow the buffer of point, line and polygon layer

Parameters
..........

  Input vector layer

``Distance`` [number]
  Distance radius of the buffer calculated from the boundary of each feature.
  Moreover you can use the Data Defined button on the right to choose a field of
  from which the radius will be calculated: this way you can have different radius
  for each feature (see :ref:`qgis_variable_distance_buffer`)

  Default: *10.0*

``Segments`` [number]
  Controls the number of line segments to use to approximate a quarter circle when
  creating rounded offsets

  Default: *5*

.. _qgis_centroids:

Centroids
---------
Creates a new point layer, with points representing the centroid of the geometries
of the input layer.

The attributes associated to each point in the output layer are the same ones
associated to the original features.

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/centroids.png
   :align: center

   The red stars represent the centroids of each feature of the input layer.

In case of a multigeometry layer a single centroid will be calculated for each
feature. The resulting centroid represents the barycenter of all parts, so the
centroid can be outside the feature borders.

  Vector layer in input.

Outputs
.......

``Centroids`` [vector: point]
  Points vector layer in output.


.. _qgis_check_validity:

Check validity
--------------
Performs a validity check on the geometries of a vector layer.

The geometries are classified in three groups (valid, invalid and error) and a
vector layer is generated with the features in each of these categories:

* the **valid** layer contains only the valid features (without topological errors)
* the **invalid** layer contains all the invalid features found by the algorithm
* the **error** layer is the point layer where the invalid features have been found

The attribute table of each generated vector layer will contain some additional
information (numbers of error found and type of error):

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/check_validity.png
   :align: center

   Left the input layer. Right: in green the valid layer, in orange the invalid layer

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Source layer to check.

``Method`` [selection]
  Check validity method.

  Point layer of the exact position of the validity problems detected with the
  ``message`` field describing the error(s) found.


.. _qgis_collect_geometries:

Collect geometries
------------------
Takes a vector layer and collects its geometries into new multipart geometries.

One or more attributes can be specified to collect only geometries belonging to
the same class (having the same value for the specified attributes), alternatively
all geometries can be collected.

All output geometries will be converted to multi geometries, even those with just
a single part. This algorithm does not dissolve overlapping geometries - they will
be collected together without modifying the shape of each geometry part.

See the 'Promote to multipart' or 'Aggregate' algorithms for alternative options.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Vector layer to be transformed

``Unique ID fields`` [multipleinput]

------------------------
Creates a new vector layer that contains a single feature with geometry matching
the extent of the input layer.

It can be used in models to convert an literal extent (``xmin``, ``xmax``, ``ymin``,

in which polygons with holes have been replaced by polygons with only their external
ring. Attributes are not modified.

An optional minimum area parameter allows removing only holes which are smaller
than a specified area threshold. Leaving this parameter at ``0.0`` results in all
holes being removed.

   :align: center

   Before and after the cleaning

Parameters
..........
``Input layer`` [vector: polygon]
  Polygon layer with holes.

``Remove holes with area less than`` [number]
  Optional.

  Only holes with an area less than this threshold will be deleted. If ``0.0`` is
  added, **all** the holes will be deleted.

  Default: *0.0*

Outputs
.......

``Cleaned`` [vector: polygon]
  Vector layer without holes or holes larger than specified area


.. _qgis_densify_geometries:

Densify geometries
------------------
Takes a polygon or line layer and generates a new one in which the geometries have
a larger number of vertices than the original one.

If the geometries have z or m values present then these will be linearly interpolated
at the added vertices.

The number of new vertices to add to each feature geometry is specified as an
input parameter.

Vertices will be added to each segment of the layer.

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/densify_geometry.png
   :align: center

   Red points show the vertices before and after the densify

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: polygon, line]

``Vertices to add`` [number]
  Number of vertices to add.

  Default: *1*

Outputs
.......

``Densified`` [vector: polygon, line]

See also
........
To add vertices at specific intervals look at :ref:`qgis_densify_geometry_interval`.


.. _qgis_densify_geometry_interval:

Densify geometries given an interval
------------------------------------
Takes a polygon or line layer and generates a new one in which the geometries have
a larger number of vertices than the original one.

The geometries are densified by adding regularly placed extra vertices inside each
segment so that the maximum distance between any two vertices does not exceed the
specified distance.

The distance is expressed in the same units used by the layer CRS.

If the geometries have z or m values present then these will be linearly interpolated
at the added vertices.

Example
.......
Specifying a distance 3 would cause the segment ``[0 0] -> [10 0]`` to be converted
to ``[0 0] -> [2.5 0] -> [5 0] -> [7.5 0] -> [10 0]``, since 3 extra vertices are required
on the segment and spacing these at 2.5 increments allows them to be evenly spaced
over the segment.

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/densify_geometry_interval.png
   :align: center

   Densify geometry at a given interval

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: polygon, line]

  Densified layer with vertices added at specified intervals


See also
........
To add a specific number of vertices, look at :ref:`qgis_densify_geometries`.

--------
Takes a polygon or line vector layer and combines their geometries into new
geometries creating a new layer.

One or more attributes can be specified to dissolve only geometries belonging to
the same class (having the same value for the specified attributes), alternatively
all geometries can be dissolved.

All output geometries will be converted to multi geometries. In case the input is
a polygon layer, common boundaries of adjacent polygons being dissolved will get
erased.

The resulting attribute table will have the same fields of the input layer while
the features are *aggregated*.

the feature’s part and its index within the part (as well as its ring for polygons),
distance along original geometry and bisector angle of vertex for original geometry.

specific vertices in the input lines or polygons.

For instance, this algorithm can be used to extract the first or last vertices in
the geometry. The attributes associated to each point are the same ones associated
to the line or polygon that the point belongs to.

The vertex indices parameter accepts a comma separated string specifying the indices
of the vertices to extract. The first vertex corresponds to an index of 0, the second
vertex has an index of 1, etc. Negative indices can be used to find vertices at the
end of the geometry, e.g., an index of -1 corresponds to the last vertex, -2
corresponds to the second last vertex, etc.

Additional fields are added to the vertices indicating the specific vertex position
(e.g., 0, -1, etc), the original vertex index, the vertex’s part and its index within
the part (as well as its ring for polygons), distance along the original geometry
and bisector angle of vertex for the original geometry.

Orthogonalize
-------------
Takes a line or polygon layer and attempts to orthogonalize all the geometries
in the layer. This process shifts the vertices in the geometries to try to make every
angle in the geometry either a right angle or a straight line.


.. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/orthogonize.png
   :align: center

   In blue the source layer while the red line is the orthogonalized result

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: polygon, line]
  Input vector layer

``Maximum angle tolerance (degrees)`` [number]
  Specify the maximum deviation from a right angle or straight line a vertex can
  have for it to be adjusted. Smaller tolerances mean that only vertices which are
  already closer to right angles will be adjusted, and larger tolerances mean
  that vertices which deviate further from right angles will also be adjusted.

``Maximum algorithm iterations`` [number]
  Setting a larger number for the maximum iterations will result in a more
  orthogonal geometry at the cost of extra processing time

Output
......

``Orthogonalized`` [vector]
  Final layer with angles adjusted depending on the parameters chosen

.. _qgis_pole_of_inaccessibility:

Pole of inaccessibility
-----------------------
Calculates the pole of inaccessibility for a polygon layer, which is the most
distant internal point from the boundary of the surface.

This algorithm uses the 'polylabel' algorithm (Vladimir Agafonkin, 2016), which
is an iterative approach guaranteed to find the true pole of inaccessibility within
a specified tolerance (in layer units). More precise tolerances require more iterations
and will take longer to calculate.

The distance from the calculated pole to the polygon boundary will be stored as
a new attribute in the output layer.

.. _qgis_smooth_geometry:

Smooth geometry
---------------
Smooths the geometries in a line or polygon layer. It creates a new layer with
the same features as the ones in the input layer, but with geometries containing
a **higher number of vertices and corners** in the geometries smoothed out.

The iterations parameter dictates how many smoothing iterations will be applied
to each geometry. A higher number of iterations results in smoother geometries
with the cost of greater number of nodes in the geometries.

The offset parameter controls how "tightly" the smoothed geometries follow the
original geometries. Smaller values results in a tighter fit, and larger values
will create a looser fit.

The maximum angle parameter can be used to prevent smoothing of nodes with large
angles. Any node where the angle of the segments to either side is larger than
this will not be smoothed. For example, setting the maximum angle to 90 degrees
or lower would preserve right angles in the geometry.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: polygon, line]
  Polygon or line vector to smooth.

``Iterations`` [number]
  With many iterations the resulting layer will have many nodes.

  Default: *1*

  .. figure:: /static/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/smooth_geometry_1.png

     offset value of 0.50 results in the green line

``Maximum angle to smooth`` [number]

Outputs
.......

``Smoothed`` [vector]
