Clip
----

Description
...........

This algorithm extracts features from the Input Layer that fall within, or partially within, the boundaries of features in the Clip Layer. Input Layer features that fall partially within clip layer feature(s) are split along the boundary of the clip layer feature(s). If any features are selected in the Input and Clip Layers, then only those features are used in the clip operation. If no features are selected then the clip operation is performed using all features. The clip function is also known as the cookie-cutter.

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  The layer containing the features to be clipped.

``Clip layer`` [vector: any]
  The layer containing the features that are used to clip the features in the input layer.

``Open output file after running algorithm``
  Choose whether to load the clipped layer to the map canvas once the clip operation has been completed.

Outputs
.......

``Clipped`` [vector]
  Where to save the clipped layer. Can be saved to file, a temporary file or a memory layer.

Console usage
.............

::

  processing.runalg('qgis:clip', input, overlay, output)

Difference
----------


Description
...........
This algorithm extracts features from the Input layer that don't fall within the boundaries of the Difference layer. Input Layer Features that are partially within Difference layer feature(s) are split along the boundary of the clip layer feature(s). If any features are selected in the Input and Difference Layers, then only those features are used in the operation. If no features are selected then the is performed using all features. 


Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  The layer containing the features that will be reduced. 

``Difference layer`` [vector: any]
  The layer containing the features used to reduce the Input Layer.

Outputs
.......

``Difference`` [vector]
  Where to save the difference layer. Can be saved to file, a temporary file or a memory layer.

Console usage
.............

::

  processing.runalg('qgis:difference', input, overlay, output)

Intersection
------------

Description
...........

This algorithm combines features from the Input layer and the Intersect Layer, resulting in features that cover both layers' features. Input Feature(s) that only partially lie within the other layer's feature(s) are split along the boundary of the other layer's feature(s). 
If any features are selected in the Input and Intersect Layers, then only those features are used in the operation. If no features are selected then the operation is performed using all features. 

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  One layer containing feature(s) to be combined.

``Intersect layer`` [vector: any]
  Second layer containing the feature(s) to be combined.

Outputs
.......

``Intersection`` [vector]
  Where to save the intersection layer. Can be saved to file, a temporary file or a memory layer.

Console usage
.............

::

  processing.runalg('qgis:intersection', input, input2, output)

Symetrical difference
-----------------------

Description
...........
This algorithm creates a layer that includes all feature(s) that are in only one of the two input layers. Feature(s) that only partially lie within the other layer's feature(s) are split along the boundary of the other layer's feature(s). If any features are selected in the Input and Difference Layers, then only those features are used in the operation. If no features are selected then the operation is performed using all features. 

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  One layer containing feature(s) to be compared.

``Difference layer`` [vector: any]
  Second layer containing feature(s) to be compared.

Outputs
.......

``Symmetrical difference`` [vector]
  Where to save the symmetrical difference layer. Can be saved to file, a temporary file or a memory layer.

Console usage
.............

::

  processing.runalg('qgis:symetricaldifference', input, overlay, output)

Union
-----

Description
...........

  This algorithm combines the feature(s) of both layers. Features that lie partially within the other layer's features will be split. Areas that lie within both layers will be added as new features. If any features are selected in either of the layers, then only those features are used in the operation. If no features are selected then the operation is performed using all features. 

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  One layer containing feature(s) to be unioned.

``Input layer 2`` [vector: any]
  Second layer containing feature(s) to be unioned.

Outputs
.......

``Union`` [vector]
  Where to save the union layer. Can be saved to file, a temporary file or a memory layer.

Console usage
.............

::

  processing.runalg('qgis:union', input, input2, output)
