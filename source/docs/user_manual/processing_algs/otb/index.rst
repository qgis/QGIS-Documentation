`Orfeo ToolBox <http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/>`_ (OTB) is an open source
library of image processing algorithms. OTB is based on the medical image
processing library ITK and offers particular functionalities for remote sensing
image processing in general and for high spatial resolution images in
particular. Targeted algorithms for high resolution optical images (Pleiades,
SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion)
or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available.

.. note::
   Please remember that Processing contains only the interface description, so
   you need to install OTB by yourself and configure Processing properly.
