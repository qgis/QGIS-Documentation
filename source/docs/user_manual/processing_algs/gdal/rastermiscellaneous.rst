.. _gdaloverviews:

Build overviews (pyramids)
--------------------------
To speed up rendering time of raster layers overviews (pyramids) can
be created. Overviews are lower resolution copies of the data which
QGIS uses depending of the level of zoom.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL addo utility <https://gdal.org/gdaladdo.html>`_ .

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [raster]
  Input raster layer.

``Overview levels`` [string]
  Defines the number of overview levels calculated by the original resolution
  of the input raster layer. By default 4 levels will be taken into consideration.

  Default: *2 4 8 16*

``Remove all existing overviews`` [boolean]
  Removes existing overviews from the raster. By default these aren't removed.

  Default: *False*

.. _gdalbuildvirtualraster:

Build virtual raster |36|
-------------------------

With a mosaic you can merge several raster files.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL buildvrt utility <https://gdal.org/gdalbuildvrt.html>`_ .

.. _gdalmerge:

Merge
-----
Merges raster files in a simple way. Here you can use a pseudocolor
table from an input raster and define the output raster type. All
the images must be in the same coordinate system.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL merge utility <https://gdal.org/gdal_merge.html>`_ .

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Raster --> Miscellaneous`

Parameters
..........

``Input layers`` [raster] [list]
  Input raster layers.

``Grab pseudocolor table from first layer`` [boolean]
  The pseudocolor table from the first layer will be used for the
  coloring.

  Default: *False*

``Layer stack`` [boolean]
  If 'True' is chosen each input file will be placed into a separate stacked band.

  Default: *False*

``Output raster type`` [enumeration]
  Defines the output raster type. By default this will be 'Float32'.

  Options:

  * 0 --- Byte
  * 1 --- Int16
  * 2 --- UInt16
  * 3 --- UInt32
  * 4 --- Int32
  * 5 --- Float32

  Ignores pixels from files being merged in with this pixel value.

``Assign specified "nodata" value to output`` [number]
  Optional

  Assigns the specified nodata value to output bands.

``Additional creation options``
  Optional

  Allows to add one or more creation options that can be used to control
  particulars (colorimetry, block size, file compression...) about the file to be
  created. For convenience, you can rely on predefined profiles (see
  :ref:`GDAL driver options section <gdal_createoptions>`).

Outputs

``Output layer`` [raster]
  Output raster layer.

.. _gdalgdalinfo:

attribute containing the filename, and a polygon geometry outlining the raster.
This output is suitable for use with MapServer as a raster tileindex.

This algorithm is derived from the
`GDAL Tile Index utility <https://gdal.org/gdaltindex.html>`_ .

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Raster --> Miscellaneous`

Parameters

  Optional

  Geometries of input files will be transformed to the desired target coordinate
  reference system.
