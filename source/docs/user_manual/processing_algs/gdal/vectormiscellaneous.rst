The information includes the geometry type, feature count, the spatial extent,
the projection information and many more.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL ogrinfo utility <https://www.gdal.org/ogrinfo.html>`_ .

..........

``Input layer`` [vector: any]
  Input vector layer.

Outputs
.......

``Layer information`` [html]
