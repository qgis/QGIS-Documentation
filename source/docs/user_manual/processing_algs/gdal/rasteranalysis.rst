.. _gdalaspect:

Aspect
------
Generates an aspect map from any GDAL-supported elevation raster.
Aspect is the compass direction that a slope faces. The pixels will
have a value from 0-360° measured in degrees from north indicating the azimuth.
On the northern hemisphere, the north side of slopes is often shaded (small azimuth from 0°-90°),
while the southern side receives more solar radiation (higher azimuth from 180°-270°).

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL DEM utility <https://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html>`_ .

``Default menu``: :menuselection:`Raster --> Analysis`

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [raster]
  Elevation raster layer.

``Band number`` [number]
  The number of a band containing elevation values.

  Default: *1*

``Compute edges`` [boolean]
  Generates edges from the elevation raster.

  Default: *False*

``Use Zevenbergen&Thorne formula (instead of the Horn's one)`` [boolean]
  Activates Zevenbergen&Thorne formula for smooth landscapes.

  Default: *False*

``Return trigonometric angle (instead of azimuth)`` [boolean]
  Activating the trigonometric angle results in different categories: 0° (=East), 90° (North), 180° (=West), 270° (=South).

  Default: *False*

``Return 0 for flat (instead of -9999)`` [boolean]
  Activating this option will insert a 0-value for the value -9999 on flat areas.

  Default: *False*

Outputs
.......

``Output file`` [raster]
  Output raster with angle values in degrees.


.. _gdalcolorrelief:

Color relief
------------
Generates a color relief map from any GDAL-supported elevation raster.
Color reliefs can particularly be used to depict elevations.
The Algorithm outputs a 4-band raster with values computed from the elevation
and a text-based color configuration file. By default, the colors between the given
elevation values are blended smoothly and the result is a nice colorized elevation raster.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL DEM utility <https://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html>`_ .

Parameters
..........

``Input layer`` [raster]
  Elevation raster layer.

``Band number`` [number]
  The number of a band containing elevation values.

  Default: *1*

``Compute edges`` [boolean]
  Generates edges from the elevation raster.

  Default: *False*

``Color configuration file`` [file]
  A text-based color configuration file.

``Matching mode`` [enumeration]
  The "0,0,0,0" RGBA mode results in color interpolation whereas the Exact color and
  Nearest color modes avoid interpolation of values that don't match an index of the
  color configuration file.

  Options:

  * 0 --- "0,0,0,0" RGBA
  * 1 --- Exact color
  * 2 --- Nearest color

  Default: *0*

Outputs
.......

``Output file`` [raster]

.. _gdalfillnodata:

Fill nodata
-----------
Fill raster regions with no data values by interpolation from edges. The values for
the no-data regions are calculated by the sourrounding pixel values using inverse distance
weighting. After the interpolation a smoothing of the results takes placce.
Input can be any GDAL-supported raster layer. This algorithm is generally suitable for
interpolating missing regions of fairly continuously varying rasters (such as elevation
models for instance). It is also suitable for filling small holes and cracks in more irregularly
varying images (like airphotos). It is generally not so great for interpolating a raster
from sparse point data.

This algorithm is derived from the `GDAL fillnodata utility <https://www.gdal.org/gdal_fillnodata.html>`_ .
