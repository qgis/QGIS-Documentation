blast2dem
---------

Description
...........

Turns points (up to billions) via seamless Delaunay triangulation
implemented using streaming into large elevation, intensity, or RGB rasters.

For more info see the `blast2dem <https://rapidlasso.com/blast/blast2dem>`_ page and 
its online `README <http://lastools.org/download/blast2dem_README.txt>`__ file.

Parameters
..........

``verbose`` [boolean]
  Generates more textual control output to the console.
  
  Default: *False*

  Starts the GUI of LAStools with pre-populated input files.
  
  Default: *False*
  
``input LAS/LAZ file`` [points]
  The file containing the points to be rastered in LAS/LAZ format.

``filter`` [string]
  Specifies which points to use to construct the temporary TIN that is then rastered.

  Default: *---*

  Specifies the size of the cells of the grid the TIN is rastered onto.

  Default: *1.0*

``Attribute`` [string]
