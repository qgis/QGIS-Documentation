Raster Calculator
=================

.. index:: Raster_Calculator

The :menuselection:`Raster Calculator` in the :menuselection:`Raster` menu
(see figure_raster_2_) allows to perform calculations on basis of existing
raster pixel values.
The results are written to a new raster layer with a GDAL supported format.

   Raster Calculator |nix|


The **Raster bands** list contains all loaded raster layers that can be used.
To add a raster to the raster calculator expression field, double
click its name in the Fields list. You can then use the operators to construct
calculation expressions or you can just type it into the box.

In the **Result layer** section you have to define an output layer. You can
then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input raster layer or
based on X,Y coordinates and on Columns and Rows to set the resolution of the
output layer. If the input layer has a different resolution, the values will be
resampled with nearest neighbor algorithm.

The **Operators section** contains all usable operators. To add an operator
to the raster calculator expression box, click the appropriate button. Mathematical
calculations (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ... ) and trigonometric functions (``sin``,
``cos``, ``tan``, ... ) are available. Stay tuned for more operators to come!

With the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Add result to project` checkbox the result layer
will automatically added to the legend area and can be visualized.


Examples
--------

**Convert elevation values from meter to feet**

Creating an elevation raster feet from a raster in meter, you need to use the
conversion factor for meters to feet: 3.28. The expression is:

::

 elevation@1 * 3.28

**Using a mask**

If you want to mask out parts of a raster, because you are only interested in
elevations above 0 meter, you can use following expression to create a mask
and apply the result to a raster in one step.

::

  (elevation@1 >= 0) * elevation@1

For every cell greater than or equal to 0, set its value to 1, otherwise set
it to 0. This creates the mask on the fly.
