DB Manager Plugin
=================

The DB Manager Plugin is intended to be the main tool to integrate and
manage spatial database formats supported by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite,
GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial, Virtual layers) in one user interface.
The |dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features.
You can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager, and it
will import your layer into your spatial database.
You can drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will
get imported.

   DB Manager dialog


The :menuselection:`Database` menu allows you to connect to an
existing database, to start the SQL window and to exit the DB Manager
Plugin.
Once you are connected to an existing database, the menus
:menuselection:`Schema` (relevant for DBMSs, such as PostGIS /
PostgreSQL) and :menuselection:`Table` will appear.

The :menuselection:`Schema` menu includes tools to create and delete
(only if empty) schemas and, if topology is available (e.g. with
PostGIS topology), to start a :guilabel:`TopoViewer`.

The :menuselection:`Table` menu allows you to create and edit tables
and to delete tables and views.
It is also possible to empty tables and to move tables between schemas.
You can :guilabel:`Run Vacuum Analyze` for the selected table.
*Vacuum* reclaims space and makes it available for reuse, and
*analyze* updates statistics that is used to determine the most
efficient way to execute a query.
:guilabel:`Change Logging...` allows you to add change logging
support to a table.
Finally, you can :guilabel:`Import Layer/File...` and
:guilabel:`Export to File...`.

The :guilabel:`Providers` window lists all existing databases
supported by QGIS.
With a double-click, you can connect to the database.
With the right mouse button, you can rename and delete existing schemas
and tables.
Tables can also be added to the QGIS canvas with the context menu.

If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers
four tabs.
The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table and its
geometry, as well as about existing fields, constraints and indexes.
It allows you to create a spatial index on a the selected table.
The :guilabel:`Table` tab shows the table, and the :guilabel:`Preview`
tab renders the geometries as preview.
When you open an :guilabel:`SQL Window`, it will be placed in a new
tab.

Working with the SQL Window
---------------------------

You can use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial
database.
Queries can be saved and loaded, and there the
:guilabel:`SQL Query Builder` will help you formulate your queries.
You can even view spatial output by checking :guilabel:`Load as new layer`
and specifying :guilabel:`Column(s) with unique values` (IDs),
:guilabel:`Geometry column` and :guilabel:`Layer name (prefix)`.
It is possible to highlight a portion of the SQL to only execute that
portion when pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+R` or clicking the :guilabel:`Execute`
button.

   Executing SQL queries in the DB Manager SQL window

.. note::

   The SQL Window can also be used to create Virtual Layers. In that case,
   instead of selecting a database, select **QGIS Layers** under **Virtual
   Layers** before opening the SQL Window.
   See :ref:`vector_virtual_layers` for instructions on the SQL syntax
   to use.


.. Substitutions definitions - AVOID EDITING PAST THIS LINE
   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
   source folder.
