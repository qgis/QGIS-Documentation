===================

SQL Anywhere is a proprietary relational database management system (RDBMS)
from Sybase. SQL Anywhere provides spatial support, including OGC, shapefiles
and built-in functions to export to KML, GML and SVG formats.

   SQL Anywhere dialog (KDE) |nix|

|icon_sqlanywhere| :sup:`SQL Anywhere` allows you to connect to spatially enabled
SQL Anywhere databases. The :guilabel:`Add SQL Anywhere layer` dialog is similar
in functionality to the dialogs for PostGIS and SpatiaLite.

.. FIXME Needs an example, but the database is proprietary
