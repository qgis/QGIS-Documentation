etc. and built in functions to export to KML, GML and SVG formats.

   SQL Anywhere dialog (KDE) |nix|

The |icon_sqlanywhere| :sup:`SQL Anywhere` allows to connect to spatialy enabled
SQL Anywhere databases. The :guilabel:`Add SQL Anywhere layer` dialog is similar
in functionality to the dialogs for PostGIS and SpatiaLite.

.. FIXME Needs an example, but the database is proprietary
