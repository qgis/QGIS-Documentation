|qg| as OGC Data Client
***********************

.. index:: Open_Geospatial_Consortium, OGC

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), is an international organization with more
than 300 commercial, governmental, nonprofit and research organizations worldwide.
Its members develop and implement standards for geospatial content and services,
GIS data processing and exchange.

Describing a basic data model for geographic features an increasing number
of specifications are developed to serve specific needs for interoperable
location and geospatial technology, including GIS. Further information
can be found under http://www.opengeospatial.org/.

.. index:: WMS, WFS, WCS, CAT, SFS, GML

Important OGC specifications supported by |qg| are:

* **WMS** --- Web Map Service (:ref:`ogc-wms`)
* **WMTS** --- Web Map Tile Service (:ref:`ogc-wms`)
* **WFS** --- Web Feature Service (:ref:`ogc-wfs`)
* **WFS-T** --- Web Feature Service - Transactional (:ref:`ogc-wfs`)
* **WCS** --- Web Coverage Service (:ref:`ogc-wcs`)
* **SFS** --- Simple Features for SQL (:ref:`label_postgis`)
* **GML** --- Geography Markup Language

OGC services are increasingly being used to exchange geospatial data between
different GIS implementations and data stores. |qg| can deal with the above
specifications as a client, being **SFS** (through support of the PostgreSQL
/ PostGIS data provider, see Section :ref:`label_postgis`).

WMS/WMTS Client
===============

.. index:: WMS_client
.. index:: WMTS_client

.. _`ogc-wms-about`:

Overview of WMS Support
-----------------------

|qg| currently can act as a WMS client that understands WMS 1.1, 1.1.1
and 1.3 servers. It has particularly been tested against publicly accessible
servers such as DEMIS.

WMS servers act upon requests by the client (e.g. |qg|) for a raster map
with a given extent, set of layers, symbolization style, and transparency.
The WMS server then consults its local data sources, rasterizes the map,
and sends it back to the client in a raster format. For |qg| this would
typically be JPEG or PNG.

WMS is generically a REST (Representational State Transfer) service rather
than a fully-blown Web Service. As such, you can actually take the URLs
generated by |qg| and use them in a web browser to retrieve the same images
that |qg| uses internally. This can be useful for troubleshooting, as there
are several brands of WMS servers in the market and they all have their
own interpretation of the WMS standard.

WMS layers can be added quite simply, as long as you know the URL to access
the WMS server, you have a serviceable connection to that server, and the
server understands HTTP as the data transport mechanism.

Overview of WMTS Support
------------------------

|qg| can also act as a WMTS client. WMTS is an OGC standard for distributing
tile sets of geospatial data. This is a faster and a more efficient way of
distributing data than WMS because with WMTS the tile sets are pre-generated
and the client only requests the transmission of the tiles and not their
production. A WMS request typically involves both the generation and
transmission of the data. A well known example of a non-OGC standard for
viewing tiled geospatial data is Google Maps.

In order to display the data at a variety of scales close to what the user
might want, the WMTS tile sets are produced at several different scale levels
and are made available for the GIS client to request them.

This diagram illustrates the concept of tile sets:

.. _figure_wmts_1:

.. only:: html

   **Figure WMTS 1:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_ogc/concept_wmts.png
   :align: center
   :width: 15em

   Concept of WMTS tile sets

The two types of WMTS interfaces that |qg| supports are via Key-Value-Pairs
(KVP) and RESTful. These two interfaces are different and you need to specify
them to |qg| differently.

1) In order to access a **WMTS KVP** service, a |qg| user opens the WMS/WMTS interface
and adds the following string to the URL of the WMTS tile service:

::

  "?SERVICE=WMTS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities"

An example of this type of address is

::
 
   http://opencache.statkart.no/gatekeeper/gk/gk.open_wmts?\
     service=WMTS&request=GetCapabilities

For testing the topo2 layer in this WMTS works nicely. Adding this string indicates
that a WMTS web service is to be used instead of a WMS service

2) The **RESTful WMTS** service takes a different form, it is a straightforward URL,
the format recommended by the OGC is:

::

  {WMTSBaseURL}/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml

This format helps you to recognize that it is a RESTful address. A RESTful WMTS is
accessed in |qg| by simply adding its address in the WMS setup in the URL field of
the form. An example for an Austrian basemap of this type of address is
http://maps.wien.gv.at/basemap/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml

.. note:: You can find some old service call WMS-C. Thoses services are quiet similar
   to WMTS service same purpose but working a little bit differently). You can manage
   them as the same way you do it for WMTS services. Just add ?tiled=true at the end
   of the url. See http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification for more
   information about this specification.

   When you read WMTS you can often think WMS-C also.

.. _`ogc-wms-servers`:

Selecting WMS/WMTS Servers
--------------------------

The first time you use the WMS feature, there are no servers defined.

Begin by clicking the |mActionAddWmsLayer| :sup:`Add WMS layer` button inside the
toolbar, or through the :menuselection:`Layer --> Add WMS Layer...` menu.

The dialog :guilabel:`Add Layer(s) from a Server` for adding layers from
the WMS server appears. You can add some servers to play with by clicking the
**[Add default servers]** button. This will add two WMS demo servers for you to
use, the WMS servers of the DM Solutions Group and Lizardtech. To define a new
WMS server in the tab :guilabel:`Layers`, select the **[New]** button. Then enter
the parameters to connect to your desired WMS server, as listed in table_OGC_1_:

.. _table_OGC_1:

+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                                 | A name for this connection.  This name will be used in the     |

+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Table OGC 1: WMS Connection Parameters

.. index:: Proxy, proxy-server

If you need to set up a proxy-server to be able to receive WMS-services from the
internet, you can add your proxy-server in the options. Choose menu
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options` and click on the tab :guilabel:`Network & Proxy`.
There you can add your proxy-settings and enable them by setting the |checkbox|
:guilabel:`Use proxy for web access`. Make sure that you select the correct
proxy type from the :guilabel:`Proxy type` |selectstring| dropdown menu.

Once the new WMS Server connection has been created, it will be preserved for
future |qg| sessions.

.. tip:: **On WMS Server URLs**

   Be sure, when entering in the WMS server URL, that you have the base URL.
   For example, you shouldn't have fragments such as ``request=GetCapabilities``
   or ``version=1.0.0`` in your URL.

.. _`ogc-wms-layers`:

Loading WMS/WMTS Layers
-----------------------

Once you have successfully filled in your parameters you can use the
**[Connect]** button to retrieve the capabilities of the selected server. This
includes the Image encoding, Layers, Layer Styles and Projections. Since this is
a network operation, the speed of the response depends on the quality of your
network connection to the WMS server. While downloading data from the WMS server,
the download progress is visualized in the left bottom of the WMS dialog.

.. following should be replaced in 1.8 with the response of de DM Solutions Group

Your screen should now look a bit like figure_OGR_1_, which shows the response
provided by the DM Solutions Group WMS server.

.. _figure_OGR_1:

.. only:: html

   **Figure OGR 1:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_ogc/connection_wms.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Dialog for adding a WMS server, showing its available layers |nix|

**Image Encoding**

The :guilabel:`Image encoding` section now lists the formats that are supported
by both the client and server. Choose one depending on your image accuracy
requirements.

.. tip:: **Image Encoding**

   You will typically find that a WMS server offers you the choice of JPEG
   or PNG image encoding. JPEG is a lossy compression format, whereas PNG
   faithfully reproduces the raw raster data.

   Use JPEG if you expect the WMS data to be photographic in nature and/or
   you don't mind some loss in picture quality. This trade-off typically
   reduces by 5 times the data transfer requirement compared to PNG.

   Use PNG if you want precise representations of the original data, and you
   don't mind the increased data transfer requirements.

**Options**

The Options field provides a text field where you can add a :guilabel:`Layer name`
for the WMS-layer. This name will be presented in the legend after loading
the layer.

Below the layer name you can define :guilabel:`Tile size`, if you want to set tile
sizes (eg. 256x256) to split up the WMS request into multiple requests.

The :guilabel:`Feature limit for GetFeatureInfo` defines what features from
the server to query.

If you select a WMS from the list a field with the default projection, provided
by the mapserver, appears. If the **[Change...]** button is active, you can click
on it and change the default projection of the WMS to another CRS, provided by
the WMS server.

**Layer Order**

The tab :guilabel:`Layer Order` lists the selected layers available from the
current connected WMS server. You may notice that some layers are expandable,
this means that the layer can be displayed in a choice of image styles.

You can select several layers at once, but only one image style per layer.
When several layers are selected, they will be combined at the WMS Server
and transmitted to |qg| in one go.


.. tip:: **WMS Layer Ordering**

   WMS layers rendered by a server are overlaid in the order listed in the Layers
   section, from top to bottom of the list. If you want to change the overlay
   order, you can use the tab :guilabel:`Layer Order`.

.. _`ogc-wms-transparency`:

**Transparency**

In this version of |qg|, the :guilabel:`Global transparency` setting from the
:guilabel:`Layer Properties` is hard-coded to be always on, where available.

.. index:: WMS_layer_transparency

.. tip:: **WMS Layer Transparency**

  The availability of WMS image transparency depends on the image encoding
  used: PNG and GIF support transparency, whilst JPEG leaves it unsupported.

**Coordinate Reference System**


.. index:: Coordinate_Reference_System, SRS, CRS

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is the OGC terminology for a |qg| Projection.

Each WMS Layer can be presented in multiple CRSs, depending on the capability of
the WMS server.

To choose a CRS, select **[Change...]** and a dialog similar to Figure Projection 3
in :ref:`label_projections` will appear. The main difference with the WMS version
of the screen is that only those CRSs supported by the WMS Server will be shown.

.. _`serversearch`:

Server search
-------------

Within |qg| you can search for WMS-servers. Figure_OGC_2_ shows the tab
:guilabel:`Server Search` with the :guilabel:`Add Layer(s) from a Server` dialog.

.. _Figure_OGC_2:

.. only:: html

   **Figure OGR 2:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_ogc/wms_server_search.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Dialog for searching WMS servers after some keywords |nix|

As you can see it is possible to enter a search-string in the text field and hit
the **[Search]** button. After a short while the search result will be populated
into the list below the text field. Browse the result list and inspect your search
results within the table. To visualize the results, select a table entry, press
the **[Add selected row to WMS-list]** button and change back to the tab
:guilabel:`Layers`. |qg| automatically has updated your server list and the
selected search result is already enabled in the list of saved WMS-servers in
the :guilabel:`Layers` tab. You only need to request the list of layers by clicking
the **[Connect]** button. This option is quite handy when you want to search maps
by specific keywords.

Basically this option is a frontend to the API of http://geopole.org.

.. _`tilesets`:

Tilesets
--------

.. index:: WMS_tiles, WMS-C, WMTS

When using WMTS (Cached WMS) Services like

::

  http://opencache.statkart.no/gatekeeper/gk/gk.open_wmts?\
    service=WMTS&request=GetCapabilities

you are able to browse through the tab :guilabel:`Tilesets` given by the server.
Additional information like tile size, formats and supported CRS are listed in
this table. In combination with this feature you can use the tile scale slider
from the :menuselection:`Settings --> Panels` (KDE and Windows) or :menuselection:`View --> Panels`
(Gnome and MacOSX) then choose `Tile scale`, which gives you the
available scales from the tileserver with nice slider docked in.

.. _`ogc-wms-identify`:

Using the Identify Tool
-----------------------

.. index:: WMS_identify

Once you have added a WMS server, and if any layer from a WMS server is queryable,
you can then use the |mActionIdentify| :sup:`Identify` tool to select a pixel on
the map canvas. A query is made to the WMS server for each selection made.
The results of the query are returned in plain text. The formatting of this text
is dependent on the particular WMS server used.

.. _`ogc-wms-format-selection`:

**Format selection**

If multiple output formats are supported by the server, a combo box with supported formats is automatically added to the identify results dialog and the selected format will is stored in project for the layer.

.. _`ogc-wms-gml-format-support`:

**GML format support**

The |mActionIdentify| :sup:`Identify` tool supports WMS server response (GetFeatureInfo) in GML (it is called Feature in |qg| GUI in this context) format. If "Feature" format is supported by the server and selected, results of the Identify tool are vector features like from regular vector layer. When a single feature is selected in the tree, it is highlighted in the map and it can be copied to clipboard and pasted to another vector layer. See example setup of UMN Mapserver below to support GetFeatureInfo GML format.

::

  # in layer METADATA add which fields should be included and define geometry (example):

  "gml_include_items"   "all"
  "ows_geometries"      "mygeom"
  "ows_mygeom_type"     "polygon"

  # Then there are two possibilities/formats available, see a) and b):

  # a) basic (output is generated by Mapserver and does not contain XSD)
  # in WEB METADATA define formats (example):
  "wms_getfeatureinfo_formatlist" "application/vnd.ogc.gml,text/html"

  # b) using OGR (output is generated by OGR, it is send as multipart and contains XSD)
  # in MAP define OUTPUTFORMAT (example):
  OUTPUTFORMAT
      NAME "OGRGML"
      MIMETYPE "ogr/gml"
      DRIVER "OGR/GML"
      FORMATOPTION "FORM=multipart"
  END

  # in WEB METADATA define formats (example):
  "wms_getfeatureinfo_formatlist" "OGRGML,text/html"

.. _`ogc-wms-properties`:

**Viewing Properties**

.. index:: WMS_properties

Once you have added a WMS server, you can view its properties by right-clicking
on it in the legend, and selecting :menuselection:`Properties`.

.. _`ogc-wms-properties-metadata`:

**Metadata Tab**

.. index:: WMS_metadata

The tab :guilabel:`Metadata` displays a wealth of information about the WMS
server, generally collected from the Capabilities statement returned from
that server. Many definitions can be cleaned by reading the WMS standards (see
OPEN-GEOSPATIAL-CONSORTIUM :ref:`literature_and_web`), but here are a few handy
definitions:

* **Server Properties**

  - **WMS Version** --- The WMS version supported by the server.
  - **Image Formats** --- The list of MIME-types the server can respond with
    when drawing the map. |qg| supports whatever formats the underlying Qt
    libraries were built with, which is typically at least ``image/png`` and
    ``image/jpeg``.
  - **Identity Formats** --- The list of MIME-types the server can respond
    with when you use the Identify tool. Currently |qg| supports the
    ``text-plain`` type.

* **Layer Properties**

  - **Selected** --- Whether or not this layer was selected when its server was
    added to this project.
  - **Visible** --- Whether or not this layer is selected as visible in the
    legend. (Not yet used in this version of |qg|.)
  - **Can Identify** --- Whether or not this layer will return any results
    when the Identify tool is used on it.
  - **Can be Transparent** --- Whether or not this layer can be rendered with
    transparency. This version of |qg| will always use transparency if this is
    ``Yes`` and the image encoding supports transparency
  - **Can Zoom In** --- Whether or not this layer can be zoomed in by the server.
    This version of |qg| assumes all WMS layers have this set to ``Yes``.
    Deficient layers may be rendered strangely.
  - **Cascade Count** --- WMS servers can act as a proxy to other WMS servers to
    get the raster data for a layer. This entry shows how many times the request
    for this layer is forwarded to peer WMS servers for a result.
  - **Fixed Width, Fixed Height** --- Whether or not this layer has fixed source
    pixel dimensions. This version of |qg| assumes all WMS layers have this set
    to nothing. Deficient layers may be rendered strangely.
  - **WGS 84 Bounding Box** --- The bounding box of the layer, in WGS 84
    coordinates. Some WMS servers do not set this correctly (e.g. UTM coordinates
    are used instead). If this is the case, then the initial view of this layer
    may be rendered with a very 'zoomed-out' appearance by |qg|. The WMS webmaster
    should be informed of this error, which they may know as the WMS XML elements
    ``LatLonBoundingBox``, ``EX_GeographicBoundingBox`` or the CRS:84 ``BoundingBox``.
  - **Available in CRS** --- The projections that this layer can be rendered
    in by the WMS server. These are listed in the WMS-native format.
  - **Available in style** --- The image styles that this layer can be rendered
    in by the WMS server.

.. _`ogc-wms-limits`:

WMS Client Limitations
----------------------

Not all possible WMS Client functionality had been included in this version
of |qg|. Some of the more notable exceptions follow.

**Editing WMS Layer Settings**

Once you've completed the |mActionAddWmsLayer| :sup:`Add WMS layer` procedure,
there is no ability to change the settings. A workaround is to delete the layer
completely and start again.

**WMS Servers Requiring Authentication**

Currently public accessible and secured WMS-services are supported. The secured
WMS-servers can be accessed by public authentication. You can add the (optional)
credentials when you add a WMS-server. See section :ref:`ogc-wms-servers` for
details.

.. index:: InteProxy, Secured_OGC_Authentication

.. tip:: **Accessing secured OGC-layers**

   If you need to access secured layers with other secured methods than basic
   authentication, you could use InteProxy as a transparent proxy, which does
   support several authentication methods. More information can be found at the
   InteProxy manual found on the website http://inteproxy.wald.intevation.org.

.. index:: QGIS_mapserver, WMS_1.3.0

.. tip:: **|qg| WMS Mapserver**

   From Version 1.7.0 |qg| has its own implementation of a WMS 1.3.0 Mapserver.
   Read more about this at chapter :ref:`label_qgisserver`.

.. _`ogc-wcs`:

WCS Client
==========

.. index:: WCS, Web Coverage Service

|wcs| A Web Coverage Service (WCS) provides access to raster data in forms that are useful
for client-side rendering, as input into scientific models, and for other clients.
The WCS may be compared to the WFS and the WMS. As WMS and WFS service instances, a
WCS allows clients to choose portions of a server's information holdings based on
spatial constraints and other query criteria.

|qg| has a native WCS provider and supports both version 1.0 and 1.1 (which are significantly
different), but currently it prefers 1.0, because 1.1 has many issues, each server implements it
in different way with various particularities.

The native WCS provider handles all network requests and uses all standard |qg|
network settings (especially proxy). It is also possible select cache mode
(always cache, prefer cache, prefer network, always network) and the provider also
supports selection of time position if temporal domain is offered by server.

.. _`ogc-wfs`:

WFS and WFS-T Client
====================

.. index:: WFS, WFS-T, WFS_Transactional

In |qg|, a WFS layer behaves pretty much like any other vector layer. You can
identify and select features and view the attribute table. Since |qg| 1.6 editing
(WFS-T) is also supported.

In general adding a WFS layer is very similar to the procedure used with WMS.
The difference is there are no default servers defined, so we have to add our own.

**Loading a WFS Layer**

As an example we use the DM Solutions WFS server and display a layer.
The URL is: http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap

#. Click on the |wfs| :sup:`Add WFS Layer` tool on the
   Layers toolbar, the dialog :guilabel:`Add WFS Layer from a Server` appears
#. Click on **[New]**
#. Enter 'DM Solutions' as name
#. Enter the URL (see above)
#. Click **[OK]**
#. Choose 'DM Solutions' from the dropdown list :guilabel:`Server Connections`
   |selectstring|
#. Click **[Connect]**
#. Wait for the list of layers to be populated
#. Select the :guilabel:`Parks` layer in the list
#. Click **[Apply]** to add the layer to the map

Note that proxy settings you have set in your preferences are also recognized.

   Adding a WFS layer |nix|

.. in |qg| 1.8 the following checkbox seems to be missing, maybe the
   loading of features is allready prevented by default when it is not
   the first layer loaded? This needs to be checked..

.. Without using the checkbox |checkbox|
.. :guilabel:`Only request features overlapping the current view extent`
.. |qg| fetches all features from the WFS-server. If you
.. only want to have a small selection based on your extent, zoom to the area
.. of interest, request the WFS-layer again and make sure you have checked
.. the checkbox mentioned above. Basically this adds the BBOX-parameter with
.. the values from your current extent to the WFS-query. This is extremely
.. useful when you only want to request **some** features from a huge
.. WFS-dataset.

You'll notice the download progress is visualized in the left bottom of the |qg|
main window. Once the layer is loaded, you can identify and select a province or
two and view the attribute table.

Only WFS 1.0.0 is supported. At this point there have not been many tests against
WFS versions implemented in other WFS-servers. If you encounter problems with any
other WFS-server, please do not hesitate to contact the development team. Please
refer to Section :ref:`label_helpsupport` for further information about the
mailinglists.

.. tip:: **Finding WFS Servers**

   You can find additional WFS servers by using Google or your favorite search
   engine. There are a number of lists with public URLs, some of them maintained
   and some not.
