QGIS as OGC Data Server
***********************

   :local:

QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3, WFS 1.0.0 and WCS 1 1.1.1 
implementation that, in addition, implements advanced cartographic features for 
thematic mapping. The QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) 
application written in C++ that works together with a web server (e.g., Apache, 
Lighttpd). It has Python plugin support allowing for fast and efficient 
development and deployment of new features.
The original development of QGIS Server was funded by the EU projects Orchestra,
Sany and the city of Uster in Switzerland.

.. index:: QGIS_Server, FastCGI, CGI, Common_Gateway_Interface

QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map rendering. 
Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform-independent 
C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS Server uses 
cartographic rules as a configuration language, both for the server 
configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules.

As QGIS desktop and QGIS Server use the same visualization libraries, the maps
that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS.

In the following sections, we will provide a sample configuration to set up
a QGIS Server on Debian/Ubuntu Linux.
For user contributed installation instructions on other platforms or 
distributions, we recommend reading one of the following URLs:

QGIS Server installation on Debian/Ubuntu
================================================================================

At this point, we will give a short and simple sample installation how-to for
a minimal working configuration using Apache2 on Debian Squeeze (or with 
negligible variations on Ubuntu 14.04).
Many other OSs provide packages for QGIS Server, too. If you have to build it 
all from source, please refer to the URLs above.

Firstly, add the following debian GIS repository:

::

  $ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-gis.list
  deb http://qgis.org/debian trusty main
  deb-src http://qgis.org/debian trusty main

  $ # Add keys
  $ sudo gpg --recv-key DD45F6C3
  $ sudo gpg --export --armor DD45F6C3 | sudo apt-key add -

  $ # Update package list
  $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Now, install QGIS Server:

::

  $ sudo apt-get install qgis-server python-qgis

Installation of a HelloWorld example plugin for testing the servers. You create 
a directory to hold server plugins. This will be specified in the virtual host 
configuration and passed on to the server through an environment variable:

::

  $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/qgis-server/plugins
  $ cd /opt/qgis-server/plugins
  $ sudo wget https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-helloserver/archive/master.zip
  $ # In case unzip was not installed before:
  $ sudo apt-get install unzip
  $ sudo unzip master.zip
  $ sudo mv qgis-helloserver-master HelloServer

Install the Apache server in a separate virtual host listening on port 80. 
Enable the rewrite module to pass HTTP BASIC auth headers:

::

  $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
  $ cat /etc/apache2/conf-available/qgis-server-port.conf
  Listen 80
  $ sudo a2enconf qgis-server-port

This is the virtual host configuration, stored in 
:file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-qgis-server.conf` :

::

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/qgis-server-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/qgis-server-access.log combined

    # Longer timeout for WPS... default = 40
    FcgidIOTimeout 120
    FcgidInitialEnv LC_ALL "en_US.UTF-8"
    FcgidInitialEnv PYTHONIOENCODING UTF-8
    FcgidInitialEnv LANG "en_US.UTF-8"
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_DEBUG 1
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /tmp/qgis-000.log
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_PLUGINPATH "/opt/qgis-server/plugins"

    # Needed for QGIS HelloServer plugin HTTP BASIC auth
    <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
        RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
    </IfModule>

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
    <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride All
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
	# for apache2 > 2.4
	Require all granted
        #Allow from all
    </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>

Now enable the virtual host and restart Apache:

::

  $ sudo a2ensite 001-qgis-server
  $ sudo service apache2 restart

Test the server with the HelloWorld plugin:

::

  $ wget -q -O - "http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=HELLO"
  HelloServer!


You can have a look at the default GetCapabilities of the QGIS server at:
:file:`http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities`

.. tip::

   If you work with a feature that has many nodes then modifying and adding a 
   new feature will fail. In this case it is possible to insert the following 
   code into the :file:`001-qgis-server.conf` file:
   ::

     <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
     FcgidMaxRequestLen 26214400
     FcgidConnectTimeout 60
     </IfModule>






.. _`Creating a WMS from a QGIS project`:

Creating a WMS/WFS/WCS server from a QGIS project
======================================================


To provide a new QGIS Server WMS, WFS or WCS, we have to create a QGIS project
file with some data. Here, we use the 'Alaska' shapefile from the QGIS sample
dataset. Define the colors and styles of the layers in QGIS and the project CRS,
if not already defined.

.. _figure_server_2:

.. only:: html

   **Figure Server 2:**

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ows_server_definition.png
   :align: center

   Definitions for a QGIS Server WMS/WFS/WCS project (KDE)

Then, go to the :guilabel:`OWS Server` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties` dialog and provide
some information about the OWS in the fields under
:guilabel:`Service Capabilities`.
This will appear in the GetCapabilities response of the WMS, WFS or WCS.
If you don't check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Service capabilities`,
QGIS Server will use the information given in the :file:`wms_metadata.xml` file
located in the :file:`cgi-bin` folder.

.. warning::

 If you're using the QGIS project with styling based on SVG files using
 relative paths then you should know that the server considers the path
 relative to its `qgis_mapserv.fcgi` file (not to the `qgs` file).
 So, if you deploy a project on the server and the SVG files are not placed
 accordingly, the output images may not respect the Desktop styling.
 To ensure this doesn't happen, you can simply copy the SVG files relative
 to the `qgis_mapserv.fcgi`. You can also create a symbolic link in the
 directory where the fcgi file resides that points to the directory containing
 the SVG files (on Linux/Unix).

WMS capabilities
------------------------------

In the :guilabel:`WMS capabilities` section, you can define
the extent advertised in the WMS GetCapabilities response by entering
the minimum and maximum X and Y values in the fields under
:guilabel:`Advertised extent`.
Clicking :guilabel:`Use Current Canvas Extent` sets these values to the
extent currently displayed in the QGIS map canvas.
By checking |checkbox| :guilabel:`CRS restrictions`, you can restrict
in which coordinate reference systems (CRS) QGIS Server will offer
to render maps.
Use the |mActionSignPlus| button below to select those CRSs
from the Coordinate Reference System Selector, or click :guilabel:`Used`
to add the CRSs used in the QGIS project to the list.

If you have print composers defined in your project, they will be listed in the
GetCapabilities response, and they can be used by the GetPrint request to
create prints, using one of the print composer layouts as a template.
This is a QGIS-specific extension to the WMS 1.3.0 specification.
If you want to exclude any print composer from being published by the WMS,
check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude composers` and click the
|mActionSignPlus| button below.
Then, select a print composer from the :guilabel:`Select print composer` dialog
in order to add it to the excluded composers list.

If you want to exclude any layer or layer group from being published by the
WMS, check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude Layers` and click the
|mActionSignPlus| button below.
This opens the :guilabel:`Select restricted layers and groups` dialog, which
allows you to choose the layers and groups that you don't want to be published.
Use the :kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:`Ctrl` key if you want to select multiple entries.

You can receive requested GetFeatureInfo as plain text, XML and GML. Default is XML,
text or GML format depends the output format chosen for the GetFeatureInfo request.

If you wish, you can check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Add geometry to feature response`.
This will include in the GetFeatureInfo response the geometries of the
features in a text format. If you want QGIS Server to advertise specific request URLs
in the WMS GetCapabilities response, enter the corresponding URL in the
:guilabel:`Advertised URL` field.
Furthermore, you can restrict the maximum size of the maps returned by the
GetMap request by entering the maximum width and height into the respective
fields under :guilabel:`Maximums for GetMap request`.

If one of your layers uses the Map Tip display (i.e. to show text using 
expressions) this will be listed inside the GetFeatureInfo output. If the 
layer uses a Value Map for one of its attributes, this information will also 
be shown in the GetFeatureInfo output.

QGIS supports the following requests for WMS service:

* GetCapabilities
* GetMap
* GetFeatureInfo
* GetLegendGraphic (SLD profile)
* DescribeLayer (SLD profile)
* GetStyles (custom QGIS profile)

WFS capabilities
-----------------------------

In the :guilabel:`WFS capabilities` area you can select the layers you
want to publish as WFS, and specify if they will allow update, insert and
delete operations.
If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL` field of the
:guilabel:`WFS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise this specific
URL in the WFS GetCapabilities response.

QGIS supports the following requests for WFS service:

* GetCapabilities
* DescribeFeatureType
* GetFeature
* Transaction

WCS capabilities
------------------------------

In the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` area, you can select the layers that you
want to publish as WCS. If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL` 
field of the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise 
this specific URL in the WCS GetCapabilities response.

Now, save the session in a project file :file:`alaska.qgs`. To provide the 
project as a WMS/WFS, we create a new folder ``/usr/lib/cgi-bin/project`` with 
admin privileges and add the project file :file:`alaska.qgs` and a copy of the 
:file:`qgis_mapserv.fcgi` file - that's all.

Now we test our project WMS, WFS and WCS. Add the WMS, WFS and WCS as described 
in :ref:`ogc-wms-layers`, :ref:`ogc-wfs` and :ref:`ogc-wcs` to QGIS and load 
the data. The URL is:

::

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/project/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

QGIS supports the following requests for WCS service:

* GetCapabilities
* DescribeCoverage
* GetCoverage

Fine tuning your OWS
--------------------------------------

For vector layers, the :guilabel:`Fields` menu of the
:menuselection:`Layer --> Properties` dialog allows you to define for each
attribute if it will be published or not.
By default, all the attributes are published by your WMS and WFS.
If you don't want a specific attribute to be published, uncheck the corresponding
checkbox in the :guilabel:`WMS` or :guilabel:`WFS` column.

You can overlay watermarks over the maps produced by your WMS by adding text
annotations or SVG annotations to the project file.
See the Annotation Tools section in :ref:`general_tools` for instructions on 
creating annotations. For annotations to be displayed as watermarks on the WMS 
output, the :guilabel:`Fixed map position` check box in the 
:guilabel:`Annotation text` dialog must be unchecked.
This can be accessed by double clicking the annotation while one of the
annotation tools is active.
For SVG annotations, you will need either to set the project to save absolute
paths (in the :guilabel:`General` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties` dialog) or to manually modify
the path to the SVG image so that it represents a valid relative path.



Server configuration and supported parameters
================================================================================

QGIS Server supports some vendor parameters and requests that greatly enhance the
possibilities of customising its behavior. The following paragraphs list the vendor
parameters and the environment variables supported by the server.


Extra parameters supported by all request types
--------------------------------------------------

* **FILE_NAME** parameter: if set, the server response will be sent to the 
  client as a file attachment with the specified file name.

* **MAP** parameter: Similar to MapServer, the ``MAP`` parameter can be used to
  specify the path to the QGIS project file. You can specify an absolute path
  or a path relative to the location of the server executable
  (:file:`qgis_mapserv.fcgi`).
  If not specified, QGIS Server searches for .qgs files in the directory where
  the server executable is located.

  Example::

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?\
      REQUEST=GetMap&MAP=/home/qgis/mymap.qgs&...

..  note::

    You can define a **QGIS_PROJECT_FILE** as an environment variable to tell
    the server executable where to find the QGIS project file. This variable
    will be the location where QGIS will look for the project file. If not
    defined it will use the MAP parameter in the request and finally look at
    the server executable directory.



Extra parameters supported by the WMS GetMap request
-----------------------------------------------------

In the WMS GetMap request, QGIS Server accepts a couple of extra
parameters in addition to the standard parameters according to the
OCG WMS 1.3.0 specification:


* **DPI** parameter: The ``DPI`` parameter can be used to specify the requested
  output resolution.

  Example::

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?REQUEST=GetMap&DPI=300&...

* **OPACITIES** parameter: Opacity can be set on layer or group level.
  Allowed values range from 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (fully opaque).

  Example::

    http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?\
      REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=mylayer1,mylayer2&OPACITIES=125,200&...


* **FILTER** parameter: (Available in QGIS 1.8 and above). Subsets of layers
    can be selected with the **FILTER** parameter. Syntax is basically the same
    as for the QGIS subset string. However, there are some restrictions to avoid
    SQL injections into databases via QGIS server:

    Text strings need to be enclosed with quotes (single quotes for strings, 
    double quotes for attributes)
    A space between each word / special character is mandatory.
    Allowed Keywords and special characters are 'AND','OR','IN','=','<','>=',
    '>','>=','!=*,'(',')'.
    Semicolons in string expressions are not allowed

    Example::

        http://myserver.com/cgi/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=mylayer1,mylayer2&FILTER=mylayer1:"OBJECTID" = 3;mylayer2:'text' = 'blabla'&....

.. note::

    It is possible to make attribute searches via GetFeatureInfo and omit 
    the X/Y parameter if a FILTER is there. QGIS server then returns info 
    about the matching features and generates a combined bounding box in the 
    xml output.

* **SELECTION** parameter: (Available in QGIS 1.8 and above)
    Vector features can be selected by passing comma separated lists with 
    feature ids in GetMap and GetPrint.

    Example::

        http://myserver.com/cgi/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=mylayer1,mylayer2&SELECTION=mylayer1:3,6,9;mylayer2:1,5,6&...


GetPrint request
-----------------


QGIS server has the capability to create print composer output in pdf or pixel 
format. Print composer windows in the published project are used as templates. 
In the GetPrint request, the client has the possibility to specify parameters 
of the contained composer maps and labels.

Example:

The published project has two composer maps. In the GetCapabilities response, 
they are listed as possible print templates::

    <WMS_Capabilities>
    ...
    <ComposerTemplates xsi:type="wms:_ExtendedCapabilities">
    <ComposerTemplate width="297" height="210" name="Druckzusammenstellung 1">
    <ComposerMap width="171" height="133" name="map0"/>
    <ComposerMap width="49" height="46" name="map1"/></ComposerTemplate>
    </ComposerTemplates>
    ...
    </WMS_Capabilities>

The client has now the information to request a print output::

    http://myserver.com/cgi/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?...&REQUEST=GetPrint&TEMPLATE=Druckzusammenstellung 1&map0:EXTENT=xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax&map0:ROTATION=45&FORMAT=pdf&DPI=300

Parameters in the GetPrint request are:

* <map_id>:EXTENT gives the extent for a composer map as xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax.
* <map_id>:ROTATION map rotation in degrees
* <map_id>:GRID_INTERVAL_X, <map_id>:GRID_INTERVAL_Y Grid line density for a 
  composer map in x- and y-direction
* <map_id>:SCALE Sets a mapscale to a composer map. This is useful to ensure 
  scale based visibility of layers and labels even if client and server may 
  have different algorithms to calculate the scale denominator
* <map_id>:LAYERS, <map_id>:STYLES possibility to give layer and styles list 
  for composer map (useful in case of overview maps which should have only a 
  subset of layers)


GetLegendGraphics request
---------------------------


Several additional parameters are available to change the size of the legend 
elements:

* **BOXSPACE** space between legend frame and content (mm)
* **LAYERSPACE** versical space between layers (mm)
* **LAYERTITLESPACE** vertical space between layer title and items following 
  (mm)
* **SYMBOLSPACE** vertical space between symbol and item following (mm)
* **ICONLABELSPACE** horizontal space between symbol and label text (mm)
* **SYMBOLWIDTH** width of the symbol preview (mm)
* **SYMBOLHEIGHT** height of the symbol preview (mm)

These parameters change the font properties for layer titles and item labels:

* **LAYERFONTFAMILY / ITEMFONTFAMILY** font family for layer title / item text
* **LAYERFONTBOLD / ITEMFONTBOLD** 'TRUE' to use a bold font
* **LAYERFONTSIZE / ITEMFONTSIZE** Font size in point
* **LAYERFONTITALIC / ITEMFONTITALIC** 'TRUE' to use italic font
* **LAYERFONTCOLOR / ITEMFONTCOLOR** Hex color code (e.g. #FF0000 for red)
* **LAYERTITLE / RULELABEL** (from QGIS 2.4) set them to 'FALSE' to get only 
  the legend graphics without labels

Contest based legend. These parameters let the client request a legend showing 
only the symbols for the features falling into the requested area:

* **BBOX** the geographical area for which the legend should be built
* **CRS / SRS** the coordinate reference system adopted to define the BBOX 
  coordinates
* **WIDTH / HEIGHT** if set these should match those defined for the GetMap 
  request, to let QGIS Server scale symbols according to the map view image 
  size.

Contest based legend features are based on the 
`UMN MapServer implementation: <http://www.mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-101.html>`_

GetProjectSettings request
-----------------------------

This request type works similar to **GetCapabilities**, but it is more specific 
to QGIS Server and allows a client to read additional information which is 
not available in the GetCapabilities output:

* initial visibility of layers
* information about vector attributes and their edit types
* information about layer order and drawing order
* list of layers published in WFS


DXF Export
------------

Starting with QGIS 2.11 (QGIS master as of 2015-07) it is now possible to 
export layers in the DXF format using the GetMap Request. Only layers that 
have read access in the WFS service are exported in the DXF format. Here is a 
valid REQUEST and a documentation of the available parameters::

    http://your.server.address/wms/liegenschaftsentwaesserung/abwasser_werkplan?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=Haltungen,Normschacht,Spezialbauwerke&STYLES=&CRS=EPSG%3A21781&BBOX=696136.28844801,245797.12108743,696318.91114315,245939.25832905&WIDTH=1042&HEIGHT=811&FORMAT=application/dxf&FORMAT_OPTIONS=MODE:SYMBOLLAYERSYMBOLOGY;SCALE:250&FILE_NAME=werkplan_abwasser.dxf

Parameters:

* FORMAT=application/dxf
* FILE_NAME=yoursuggested_file_name_for_download.dxf
* FORMAT_OPTIONS=see options below, key:value pairs separated by Semicolon

FORMAT_OPTIONS Parameters:

* SCALE:scale to be used for symbology rules, filters and styles (not an 
  actual scaling of the data - data remains in the original scale)
* MODE:NOSYMBOLOGY|FEATURESYMBOLOGY|SYMBOLLAYERSYMBOLOGY corresponds to the 
  three export options offered in the QGIS Desktop DXF export dialogue
* LAYERSATTRIBUTES:yourcolumn_with_values_to_be_used_for_dxf_layernames - if 
  not specified, the original QGIS layer names are used

Extra parameters supported by the WFS GetFeature request
---------------------------------------------------------

In the WFS GetFeature request, QGIS Server accepts one extra parameter in 
addition to the standard parameters according to the OCG WFS 1.1.0 
specification:

* **GeometryName** parameter: this parameter can be used to get the *extent* 
  or the *centroid* as the geometry or no geometry if *none* if used (ie 
  attribute only). Allowed values are *extent*, *centroid* or *none*.

.. index::
    pair: logging; QGIS Server

QGIS Server logging
----------------------------------

To log requests sent to the server, set the following environment variables:

* **QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE**: Specify path and filename. Make sure that the
  server has proper permissions for writing to file. File should be created 
  automatically, just send some requests to server. If it's not there, check 
  permissions.
* **QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL**: Specify desired log level. Available values are:

  * 0 INFO (log all requests),
  * 1 WARNING,
  * 2 CRITICAL (log just critical errors, suitable for production purposes).

  Example::

    SetEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /var/tmp/qgislog.txt
    SetEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0

.. note::

    * When using Fcgid module use FcgidInitialEnv instead of SetEnv!
    * Server logging is also enabled if executable is compiled in release mode.


.. index::
    pair: environment; QGIS Server

Environment variables
---------------------------------

You can configure some aspects of QGIS server by setting **environment 
variables**. For example, to set QGIS server on Apache to use 
/path/to/config/QGIS/QGIS2.ini settings file, add to Apache config:

::

  SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/path/to/config/"

or, if using fcgi:

::

  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/path/to/config/"


This is a list of the variables supported by QGIS server:

* **QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH**: Specifies the path to the directory with settings.
  It works the same way as QGIS application --optionspath option. It is looking
  for settings file in <QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH>/QGIS/QGIS2.ini.
* **QUERY_STRING**: The query string, normally passed by the web server. This 
  variable can be useful while testing QGIS server binary from the command line.
* **QGIS_PROJECT_FILE**: the `.qgs` project file, normally passed as a parameter 
  in the query string, you can also set it as an environment variable (for 
  example by using `mod_rewrite` Apache module).
* **QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE**: Specify path and filename. Make sure that server
  has proper permissions for writing to file. File should be created 
  automatically, just send some requests to server. If it's not there, check 
  permissions.
* **QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL**: Specify desired log level. Available values are:
* **MAX_CACHE_LAYERS**: Specify the maximum number of cached layers (default: 
  100).
* **DISPLAY**: This is used to pass (fake) X server display number (needed on 
  Unix-like systems).
* **QGIS_PLUGINPATH**: Useful if you are using Python plugins for the server, 
  this sets the folder that is searched for Python plugins.
