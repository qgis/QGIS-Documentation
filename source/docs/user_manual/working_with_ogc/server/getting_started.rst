Installation
============

.. index:: Apache, Debian, Ubuntu

At this point, we will give a short and simple sample installation how-to for
a minimal working configuration using Apache2 on Debian/Ubuntu.
The first step is QGIS Server installation whose instructions are provided
in `QGIS installers page <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html>`_.


HTTP Server configuration
=========================

Apache
------

Create a writable HOME directory for QGIS server to store configurations such as SSL client configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

 $ sudo mkdir -p /srv/qgis/.qgis2
 $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /srv/qgis/.qgis2


Install the Apache server in a separate virtual host listening on port ``80``.
Enable the rewrite module to pass HTTP BASIC auth headers:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
  $ cat /etc/apache2/conf-available/qgis-server-port.conf
  Listen 80
  $ sudo a2enconf qgis-server-port

This is the virtual host configuration, stored in
:file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-qgis-server.conf`:

.. code-block:: apache

   <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/qgis-server-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/qgis-server-access.log combined

    # Longer timeout for WPS... default = 40
    FcgidIOTimeout 120
    FcgidInitialEnv LC_ALL "en_US.UTF-8"
    FcgidInitialEnv PYTHONIOENCODING UTF-8
    FcgidInitialEnv LANG "en_US.UTF-8"
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_DEBUG 1
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /tmp/qgis-000.log
    FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0

    # set HOME directory for QGIS configurations
    FcgidInitialEnv HOME "/srv/qgis"

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
    <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride All
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
	# for apache2 > 2.4
	Require all granted
        #Allow from all
    </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>

Now enable the virtual host and restart Apache:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo a2ensite 001-qgis-server
  $ sudo service apache2 restart

.. index:: nginx

NGINX
-----

You can use QGIS Server with `nginx <http://nginx.org/>`_.

On Debian based systems:

.. code-block:: bash

 apt-get install nginx fcgiwrap

Introduce the following in your nginx server block configuration:

.. code-block:: nginx
   :linenos:

     location ~ ^/cgi-bin/.*\.fcgi$ {
         gzip           off;
         include fastcgi_params;
         fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;

         fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi;
         fastcgi_param  QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /logs/qgisserver.log;
         fastcgi_param  QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0;
         fastcgi_param  QGIS_DEBUG 1;
     }

As you can see from lines ``6-9`` you can add parameters in your location block
in the form of ``fastcgi_param param_name param_value``,
e.g. ``fastcgi_param  DISPLAY ":99";``.

The ``include fastcgi_params;`` is important as it adds the parameters from
:file:`/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params`:

.. code-block:: nginx

 fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
 fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
 fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;

 fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
 fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
 fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
 fastcgi_param  REQUEST_SCHEME     $scheme;
 fastcgi_param  HTTPS              $https if_not_empty;

 fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;

 fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
 fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
 fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;

 # PHP only, required if PHP was built with --enable-force-cgi-redirect
 fastcgi_param  REDIRECT_STATUS    200;

.. _`Creatingwmsfromproject`:

Prepare a project to serve
==========================

To provide a new QGIS Server WMS, WFS or WCS, we have to create a QGIS project
file with some data. Here, we use the 'Alaska' shapefile from the QGIS sample
dataset. Define the colors and styles of the layers in QGIS and the project CRS,
if not already defined.

.. _figure_server_definitions:

.. figure:: /static/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ows_server_definition.png
   :align: center

   Definitions for a QGIS Server WMS/WFS/WCS project

Then, go to the :guilabel:`OWS Server` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties` dialog and provide
some information about the OWS in the fields under
:guilabel:`Service Capabilities`.
This will appear in the GetCapabilities response of the WMS, WFS or WCS.
If you don't check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Service capabilities`,
QGIS Server will use the information given in the :file:`wms_metadata.xml` file
located in the :file:`cgi-bin` folder.

.. warning::

 If you're using the QGIS project with styling based on SVG files using
 relative paths then you should know that the server considers the path
 relative to its :file:`qgis_mapserv.fcgi` file (not to the :file:`qgs` file).
 So, if you deploy a project on the server and the SVG files are not placed
 accordingly, the output images may not respect the Desktop styling.
 To ensure this doesn't happen, you can simply copy the SVG files relative
 to the :file:`qgis_mapserv.fcgi`. You can also create a symbolic link in the
 directory where the fcgi file resides that points to the directory containing
 the SVG files (on Linux/Unix).

WMS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WMS capabilities` section, you can define
the extent advertised in the WMS GetCapabilities response by entering
the minimum and maximum X and Y values in the fields under
:guilabel:`Advertised extent`.
Clicking :guilabel:`Use Current Canvas Extent` sets these values to the
extent currently displayed in the QGIS map canvas.
By checking |checkbox| :guilabel:`CRS restrictions`, you can restrict
in which coordinate reference systems (CRS) QGIS Server will offer
to render maps.
Use the |signPlus| button below to select those CRSs
from the Coordinate Reference System Selector, or click :guilabel:`Used`
to add the CRSs used in the QGIS project to the list.

If you have print composers defined in your project, they will be listed in the
`GetProjectSettings` response, and they can be used by the GetPrint request to
create prints, using one of the print composer layouts as a template.
This is a QGIS-specific extension to the WMS 1.3.0 specification.
If you want to exclude any print composer from being published by the WMS,
check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude composers` and click the
|signPlus| button below.
Then, select a print composer from the :guilabel:`Select print composer` dialog
in order to add it to the excluded composers list.

If you want to exclude any layer or layer group from being published by the
WMS, check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Exclude Layers` and click the
|signPlus| button below.
This opens the :guilabel:`Select restricted layers and groups` dialog, which
allows you to choose the layers and groups that you don't want to be published.
Use the :kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:`Ctrl` key if you want to select multiple entries.

You can receive requested GetFeatureInfo as plain text, XML and GML. Default is XML,
text or GML format depends the output format chosen for the GetFeatureInfo request.

If you wish, you can check |checkbox| :guilabel:`Add geometry to feature response`.
This will include in the GetFeatureInfo response the geometries of the
features in a text format. If you want QGIS Server to advertise specific request URLs
in the WMS GetCapabilities response, enter the corresponding URL in the
:guilabel:`Advertised URL` field.
Furthermore, you can restrict the maximum size of the maps returned by the
GetMap request by entering the maximum width and height into the respective
fields under :guilabel:`Maximums for GetMap request`.

If one of your layers uses the :ref:`Map Tip display <maptips>` (i.e. to show text using
expressions) this will be listed inside the GetFeatureInfo output. If the
layer uses a Value Map for one of its attributes, this information will also
be shown in the GetFeatureInfo output.

WFS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WFS capabilities` area you can select the layers you
want to publish as WFS, and specify if they will allow update, insert and
delete operations.
If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL` field of the
:guilabel:`WFS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise this specific
URL in the WFS GetCapabilities response.

WCS capabilities
----------------

In the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` area, you can select the layers that you
want to publish as WCS. If you enter a URL in the :guilabel:`Advertised URL`
field of the :guilabel:`WCS capabilities` section, QGIS Server will advertise
this specific URL in the WCS GetCapabilities response.

Fine tuning your OWS
----------------------

For vector layers, the :guilabel:`Fields` menu of the
:menuselection:`Layer --> Properties` dialog allows you to define for each
attribute if it will be published or not.
By default, all the attributes are published by your WMS and WFS.
If you don't want a specific attribute to be published, uncheck the corresponding
checkbox in the :guilabel:`WMS` or :guilabel:`WFS` column.

You can overlay watermarks over the maps produced by your WMS by adding text
annotations or SVG annotations to the project file.
See the :ref:`sec_annotations` section for instructions on
creating annotations. For annotations to be displayed as watermarks on the WMS
output, the :guilabel:`Fixed map position` checkbox in the
:guilabel:`Annotation text` dialog must be unchecked.
This can be accessed by double clicking the annotation while one of the
annotation tools is active.
For SVG annotations, you will need either to set the project to save absolute
paths (in the :guilabel:`General` menu of the
:menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties` dialog) or to manually modify
the path to the SVG image so that it represents a valid relative path.

Serve the project
-----------------

Now, save the session in a project file :file:`alaska.qgs`. To provide the
project as a WMS/WFS, we create a new folder ``/usr/lib/cgi-bin/project`` with
admin privileges and add the project file :file:`alaska.qgs` and a copy of the
:file:`qgis_mapserv.fcgi` file - that's all.

Now we test our project WMS, WFS and WCS. Add the WMS, WFS and WCS as described
in :ref:`ogc-wms-layers`, :ref:`ogc-wfs` and :ref:`ogc-wcs` to QGIS and load
the data. The URL is:

::

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/project/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
