This section summarizes various actions that can be done with vector layers.

.. index::
  single: PyQGIS; Vector layers

Retrieving information about attributes
========================================

You can retrieve information about the fields associated with a vector layer
by calling :func:`fields` on a :class:`QgsVectorLayer` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    # "layer" is a QgsVectorLayer instance
    for field in layer.fields():
        print(field.name(), field.typeName())


.. index:: Iterating features

Iterating over Vector Layer
===========================

Iterating over the features in a vector layer is one of the most common tasks.
Below is an example of the simple basic code to perform this task and showing
some information about each feature. The ``layer`` variable is assumed to have
a :class:`QgsVectorLayer` object.

.. code-block:: python

 layer = iface.activeLayer()
 features = layer.getFeatures()

 for feature in features:
     # retrieve every feature with its geometry and attributes
     print("Feature ID: ", feature.id())
     # fetch geometry
     # show some information about the feature geometry
     geom = feature.geometry()
     geomSingleType = QgsWkbTypes.isSingleType(geom.wkbType())

     if geom.type() == QgsWkbTypes.PointGeometry:
         # the geometry type can be of single or multi type
         if geomSingleType:
             x = geom.asPoint()
             print("Point: ", x)
         else:
             x = geom.asMultiPoint()
             print("MultiPoint: ", x)

     elif geom.type() == QgsWkbTypes.LineGeometry:
         if geomSingleType:
             x = geom.asPolyline()
             print("Line: ", x, "length: ", geom.length())
         else:
             x = geom.asMultiPolyline()
             print("MultiLine: ", x, "length: ", geom.length())

     elif geom.type() == QgsWkbTypes.PolygonGeometry:
         if geomSingleType:
             x = geom.asPolygon()
             print("Polygon: ", x, "Area: ", geom.area())
         else:
             x = geom.asMultiPolygon()
             print("MultiPolygon: ", x, "Area: ", geom.area())
     else:
         print("Unknown or invalid geometry")

     # fetch attributes
     attrs = feature.attributes()

     # attrs is a list. It contains all the attribute values of this feature
     print(attrs)

.. index:: Selecting features

Selecting features
==================

In QGIS desktop, features can be selected in different ways, the user can click
on a feature, draw a rectangle on the map canvas or use an expression filter.
Selected features are normally highlighted in a different color (default
is yellow) to draw user's attention on the selection.

Sometimes can be useful to programmatically select features or to change the
default color.

To select all the features:

.. code-block:: python

 # Get the active layer (must be a vector layer)
 layer = iface.activeLayer()
 layer.selectAll()
 
To select using an expression:

.. code-block:: python

 # Assumes that the active layer is points.shp file from the QGIS test suite
 # (Class (string) and Heading (number) are attributes in points.shp)
 layer = iface.activeLayer()
 layer.selectByExpression('"Class"=\'B52\' and "Heading" > 10 and "Heading" <70', QgsVectorLayer.SetSelection)

To change the selection color you can use :func:`setSelectionColor()`
method of :class:`QgsMapCanvas` as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    iface.mapCanvas().setSelectionColor( QColor("red") )


To add features to the selected features list for a given layer, you
can call :func:`select()` passing to it the list of features IDs:

.. code-block:: python

 selected_fid = []

 # Get the first feature id from the layer
 for feature in layer.getFeatures():
     selected_fid.append(feature.id())
     break

 # Add these features to the selected list
 layer.select(selected_fid)

To clear the selection:

.. code-block:: python

 layer.removeSelection()

Accessing attributes
--------------------

Attributes can be referred to by their name:

.. code-block:: python

 print(feature['name'])

Alternatively, attributes can be referred to by index.
This is a bit faster than using the name.
For example, to get the first attribute:

.. code-block:: python

 print(feature[0])

Iterating over selected features
--------------------------------

if you only need selected features, you can use the :func:`selectedFeatures`
method from vector layer:

.. code-block:: python

  selection = layer.selectedFeatures()
  print(len(selection))
  for feature in selection:
      # do whatever you need with the feature


Iterating over a subset of features
-----------------------------------

If you want to iterate over a given subset of features in a layer, such as
those within a given area, you have to add a :obj:`QgsFeatureRequest` object
to the :func:`getFeatures()` call. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

 areaOfInterest = QgsRectangle(450290,400520, 450750,400780)

 request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(areaOfInterest)

 for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
     # do whatever you need with the feature

For the sake of speed, the intersection is often done only using featureâ€™s
bounding box. There is however a flag ``ExactIntersect`` that makes sure that
only intersecting features will be returned:

.. code-block:: python

  request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(areaOfInterest).setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.ExactIntersect)
  
With :func:`setLimit()` you can limit the number of requested features. 
Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

  request = QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.setLimit(2)
  for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
      # loop through only 2 features


If you need an attribute-based filter instead (or in addition) of a spatial
one like shown in the examples above, you can build an :obj:`QgsExpression`
object and pass it to the :obj:`QgsFeatureRequest` constructor.
Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

  # The expression will filter the features where the field "location_name"
  # contains the word "Lake" (case insensitive)
  exp = QgsExpression('location_name ILIKE \'%Lake%\'')
  request = QgsFeatureRequest(exp)


See :ref:`expressions` for the details about the syntax supported by :class:`QgsExpression`.

The request can be used to define the data retrieved for each feature, so the
iterator returns all features, but returns partial data for each of them.

.. code-block:: python

  # Only return selected fields to increase the "speed" of the request
  request.setSubsetOfAttributes([0,2])

  # More user friendly version
  request.setSubsetOfAttributes(['name','id'],layer.fields())

  # Don't return geometry objects to increase the "speed" of the request
  request.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry)

  # Fetch only the feature with id 45
  request.setFilterFid(45)
  
  # The options may be chained
  request.setFilterRect(areaOfInterest).setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry).setFilterFid(45).setSubsetOfAttributes([0,2])

.. index:: Vector layers; Editing
.. _editing:

Modifying Vector Layers
=======================

Most vector data providers support editing of layer data. Sometimes they support
just a subset of possible editing actions. Use the :func:`capabilities` function
to find out what set of functionality is supported

.. code-block:: python

  caps = layer.dataProvider().capabilities()
  # Check if a particular capability is supported:
  if caps & layer.dataProvider().DeleteFeatures:
      print('The layer supports DeleteFeatures')

For a list of all available capabilities, please refer to the
`API Documentation of QgsVectorDataProvider
<https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Vector/QgsVectorDataProvider.html>`_

To print layer's capabilities textual description in a comma separated list you
can use :func:`capabilitiesString` as in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

  caps_string = layer.dataProvider().capabilitiesString()
  # Print:
  # 'Add Features, Delete Features, Change Attribute Values, Add Attributes,
  # Delete Attributes, Rename Attributes, Fast Access to Features at ID,
  # Presimplify Geometries, Presimplify Geometries with Validity Check,
  # Transactions, Curved Geometries'

By using any of the following methods for vector layer editing, the changes are
directly committed to the underlying data store (a file, database etc). In case
you would like to do only temporary changes, skip to the next section that
explains how to do :ref:`modifications with editing buffer <editing-buffer>`.


.. note::

 If you are working inside QGIS (either from the console or from a plugin),
 it might be necessary to force a redraw of the map canvas in order to see
 the changes you've done to the geometry, to the style or to the attributes:

 .. code-block:: python

  # If caching is enabled, a simple canvas refresh might not be sufficient
  # to trigger a redraw and you must clear the cached image for the layer
  if iface.mapCanvas().isCachingEnabled():
      layer.triggerRepaint()
  else:
      iface.mapCanvas().refresh()


Add Features
------------

Create some :class:`QgsFeature` instances and pass a list of them to provider's
:func:`addFeatures` method. It will return two values: result (true/false) and
list of added features (their ID is set by the data store).

To set up the attributes you can either initialize the feature passing a
:class:`QgsFields` instance or call :func:`initAttributes` passing
the number of fields you want to be added.

.. code-block:: python

  if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.AddFeatures:
      feat = QgsFeature(layer.fields())
      feat.setAttributes([0, 'hello'])
      # Or set a single attribute by key or by index:
      feat.setAttribute('name', 'hello')
      feat.setAttribute(0, 'hello')
      feat.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(123, 456)))
      (res, outFeats) = layer.dataProvider().addFeatures([feat])


Delete Features
---------------

To delete some features, just provide a list of their feature IDs

.. code-block:: python

  if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.DeleteFeatures:
      res = layer.dataProvider().deleteFeatures([5, 10])

Modify Features
---------------

It is possible to either change feature's geometry or to change some attributes.
The following example first changes values of attributes with index 0 and 1,
then it changes the feature's geometry

.. code-block:: python

  fid = 100   # ID of the feature we will modify

  if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.ChangeAttributeValues:
      attrs = { 0 : "hello", 1 : 123 }
      layer.dataProvider().changeAttributeValues({ fid : attrs })

  if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.ChangeGeometries:
      geom = QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(111,222))
      layer.dataProvider().changeGeometryValues({ fid : geom })


.. tip:: **Favor QgsVectorLayerEditUtils class for geometry-only edits**

    If you only need to change geometries, you might consider using
    the :class:`QgsVectorLayerEditUtils` which provides some of useful
    methods to edit geometries (translate, insert or move vertex etc.).

.. tip:: **Directly save changes using** ``with`` **based command**

    Using ``with edit(layer):`` the changes will be commited automatically
    calling :func:`commitChanges()` at the end. If any exception occurs, it will
    :func:`rollBack()` all the changes. See :ref:`editing-buffer`.

.. _editing-buffer:

Modifying Vector Layers with an Editing Buffer
----------------------------------------------

When editing vectors within QGIS application, you have to first start editing
mode for a particular layer, then do some modifications and finally commit (or
rollback) the changes. All the changes you do are not written until you commit
them --- they stay in layer's in-memory editing buffer. It is possible to use
this functionality also programmatically --- it is just another method for
vector layer editing that complements the direct usage of data providers. Use
this option when providing some GUI tools for vector layer editing, since this
will allow user to decide whether to commit/rollback and allows the usage of
undo/redo. When committing changes, all changes from the editing buffer are
saved to data provider.

To find out whether a layer is in editing mode, use :func:`isEditable` --- the
editing functions work only when the editing mode is turned on. Usage of
editing functions

.. code-block:: python

  from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QVariant

  # add two features (QgsFeature instances)
  layer.addFeatures([feat1,feat2])
  # delete a feature with specified ID
  layer.deleteFeature(fid)

  # set new geometry (QgsGeometry instance) for a feature
  layer.changeGeometry(fid, geometry)
  # update an attribute with given field index (int) to given value (QVariant)
  layer.changeAttributeValue(fid, fieldIndex, value)

  # add new field
  layer.addAttribute(QgsField("mytext", QVariant.String))
  # remove a field
  layer.deleteAttribute(fieldIndex)

In order to make undo/redo work properly, the above mentioned calls have to be
wrapped into undo commands. (If you do not care about undo/redo and want to
have the changes stored immediately, then you will have easier work by
:ref:`editing with data provider <editing>`.) How to use the undo functionality

.. code-block:: python

  layer.beginEditCommand("Feature triangulation")

  # ... call layer's editing methods ...

  if problem_occurred:
    layer.destroyEditCommand()
    return

  # ... more editing ...

  layer.endEditCommand()

The :func:`beginEditCommand` will create an internal "active" command and will
record subsequent changes in vector layer. With the call to :func:`endEditCommand`
the command is pushed onto the undo stack and the user will be able to undo/redo
it from GUI. In case something went wrong while doing the changes, the
:func:`destroyEditCommand` method will remove the command and rollback all
changes done while this command was active.

To start editing mode, there is :func:`startEditing()` method, to stop editing
there are :func:`commitChanges()` and :func:`rollBack()` --- however normally
you should not need these methods and leave this functionality to be triggered
by the user.

You can also use the :code:`with edit(layer)`-statement to wrap commit and rollback into
a more semantic code block as shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

  with edit(layer):
    feat = next(layer.getFeatures())
    feat[0] = 5
    layer.updateFeature(feat)


This will automatically call :func:`commitChanges()` in the end.
If any exception occurs, it will :func:`rollBack()` all the changes.
In case a problem is encountered within :func:`commitChanges()` (when the method
returns False) a :class:`QgsEditError` exception will be raised.

Adding and Removing Fields
--------------------------

To add fields (attributes), you need to specify a list of field definitions.
For deletion of fields just provide a list of field indexes.

.. code-block:: python

 from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QVariant

 if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.AddAttributes:
     res = layer.dataProvider().addAttributes(
         [QgsField("mytext", QVariant.String),
         QgsField("myint", QVariant.Int)])

 if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.DeleteAttributes:
     res = layer.dataProvider().deleteAttributes([0])

After adding or removing fields in the data provider the layer's fields need
to be updated because the changes are not automatically propagated.

.. code-block:: python

 layer.updateFields()


.. index:: Spatial index

Using Spatial Index
===================

Spatial indexes can dramatically improve the performance of your code if you
need to do frequent queries to a vector layer. Imagine, for instance, that you
are writing an interpolation algorithm, and that for a given location you need
to know the 10 closest points from a points layer, in order to use those point
for calculating the interpolated value. Without a spatial index, the only way
for QGIS to find those 10 points is to compute the distance from each and every
point to the specified location and then compare those distances. This can be a
very time consuming task, especially if it needs to be repeated for several
locations. If a spatial index exists for the layer, the operation is much more
effective.

Think of a layer without a spatial index as a telephone book in which telephone
numbers are not ordered or indexed. The only way to find the telephone number
of a given person is to read from the beginning until you find it.

Spatial indexes are not created by default for a QGIS vector layer, but you can
create them easily. This is what you have to do:

* create spatial index --- the following code creates an empty index

  ::

     index = QgsSpatialIndex()

* add features to index --- index takes :class:`QgsFeature` object and adds it
  to the internal data structure. You can create the object manually or use
  one from previous call to provider's :func:`nextFeature()`

  ::

     index.insertFeature(feat)

* alternatively, you can load all features of a layer at once using bulk loading

  ::

     index = QgsSpatialIndex(layer.getFeatures())

* once spatial index is filled with some values, you can do some queries

  .. code-block:: python

    # returns array of feature IDs of five nearest features
    nearest = index.nearestNeighbor(QgsPoint(25.4, 12.7), 5)

    # returns array of IDs of features which intersect the rectangle
    intersect = index.intersects(QgsRectangle(22.5, 15.3, 23.1, 17.2))


.. index:: Vector layers; Creating

Writing Vector Layers
=====================

You can write vector layer files using :class:`QgsVectorFileWriter` class. It
supports any other kind of vector file that OGR supports (Shapefile, GeoJSON,
KML and others).

There are two possibilities how to export a vector layer:

* from an instance of :class:`QgsVectorLayer`

  .. code-block:: python

    error = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(layer, "my_shapes.shp", "CP1250", None, "ESRI Shapefile")

    if error == QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
        print("success!")

    error = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(layer, "my_json.json", "utf-8", None, "GeoJSON")
    if error == QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
        print("success again!")

  The third parameter specifies output text encoding. Only some drivers need this
  for correct operation - Shapefile is one of those --- however in case you
  are not using international characters you do not have to care much about
  the encoding. The fourth parameter that we left as ``None`` may specify
  destination CRS --- if a valid instance of :class:`QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem`
  is passed, the layer is transformed to that CRS.

  For valid driver names please consult the `supported formats by OGR`_ --- you
  should pass the value in the "Code" column as the driver name. Optionally
  you can set whether to export only selected features, pass further
  driver-specific options for creation or tell the writer not to create
  attributes --- look into the documentation for full syntax.

* directly from features

  .. code-block:: python

    from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QVariant

    # define fields for feature attributes. A QgsFields object is needed
    fields = QgsFields()
    fields.append(QgsField("first", QVariant.Int))
    fields.append(QgsField("second", QVariant.String))

    """ create an instance of vector file writer, which will create the vector file.
    Arguments:
    1. path to new file (will fail if exists already)
    2. encoding of the attributes
    3. field map
    4. geometry type - from WKBTYPE enum
    5. layer's spatial reference (instance of
       QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem) - optional
    6. driver name for the output file """
    writer = QgsVectorFileWriter("my_shapes.shp", "CP1250", fields, QGis.WKBPoint, None, "ESRI Shapefile")

    if writer.hasError() != QgsVectorFileWriter.NoError:
        print("Error when creating shapefile: ",  w.errorMessage())

    # add a feature
    fet = QgsFeature()
    fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(10,10)))
    fet.setAttributes([1, "text"])
    writer.addFeature(fet)

    # delete the writer to flush features to disk
    del writer

.. index:: Memory layer

Memory Provider
===============

Memory provider is intended to be used mainly by plugin or 3rd party app
developers. It does not store data on disk, allowing developers to use it as a
fast backend for some temporary layers.

The provider supports string, int and double fields.

The memory provider also supports spatial indexing, which is enabled by calling
the provider's :func:`createSpatialIndex` function. Once the spatial index is
created you will be able to iterate over features within smaller regions faster
(since it's not necessary to traverse all the features, only those in specified
rectangle).

A memory provider is created by passing ``"memory"`` as the provider string to
the :class:`QgsVectorLayer` constructor.

The constructor also takes a URI defining the geometry type of the layer,
one of: ``"Point"``, ``"LineString"``, ``"Polygon"``, ``"MultiPoint"``,
``"MultiLineString"``, or ``"MultiPolygon"``.

The URI can also specify the coordinate reference system, fields, and indexing
of the memory provider in the URI. The syntax is:

crs=definition
    Specifies the coordinate reference system, where definition may be any
    of the forms accepted by :func:`QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.createFromString`

index=yes
    Specifies that the provider will use a spatial index

field=name:type(length,precision)
    Specifies an attribute of the layer.  The attribute has a name, and
    optionally a type (integer, double, or string), length, and precision.
    There may be multiple field definitions.

The following example of a URI incorporates all these options

::

  "Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes"

The following example code illustrates creating and populating a memory provider

.. code-block:: python

  from qgis.PyQt.QtCore import QVariant

  # create layer
  vl = QgsVectorLayer("Point", "temporary_points", "memory")
  pr = vl.dataProvider()

  # add fields
  pr.addAttributes([QgsField("name", QVariant.String),
                      QgsField("age",  QVariant.Int),
                      QgsField("size", QVariant.Double)])
  vl.updateFields() # tell the vector layer to fetch changes from the provider

  # add a feature
  fet = QgsFeature()
  fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPointXY(QgsPointXY(10,10)))
  fet.setAttributes(["Johny", 2, 0.3])
  pr.addFeatures([fet])

  # update layer's extent when new features have been added
  # because change of extent in provider is not propagated to the layer
  vl.updateExtents()

Finally, let's check whether everything went well

.. code-block:: python

  # show some stats
  print("fields:", len(pr.fields()))
  print("features:", pr.featureCount())
  e = vl.extent()
  print("extent:", e.xMinimum(), e.yMinimum(), e.xMaximum(), e.yMaximum())

  # iterate over features
  features = vl.getFeatures()
  for fet in features:
      print("F:", fet.id(), fet.attributes(), fet.geometry().asPoint())

.. index:: Vector layers; Symbology

Appearance (Symbology) of Vector Layers
=======================================

.. **FOR WRITERS**: This section has been updated to QGIS3, down to...

When a vector layer is being rendered, the appearance of the data is given by
**renderer** and **symbols** associated with the layer.  Symbols are classes
which take care of drawing of visual representation of features, while
renderers determine what symbol will be used for a particular feature.

The renderer for a given layer can be obtained as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

  renderer = layer.renderer()

And with that reference, let us explore it a bit

.. code-block:: python

  print("Type:", renderer.type())

There are several known renderer types available in the QGIS core library:

=================  =======================================  ===================================================================
Type               Class                                    Description
=================  =======================================  ===================================================================
singleSymbol       :class:`QgsSingleSymbolRenderer`         Renders all features with the same symbol
categorizedSymbol  :class:`QgsCategorizedSymbolRenderer`    Renders features using a different symbol for each category
graduatedSymbol    :class:`QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer`      Renders features using a different symbol for each range of values
=================  =======================================  ===================================================================

There might be also some custom renderer types, so never make an assumption
there are just these types. You can query the application's :class:`QgsRendererRegistry`
to find out currently available renderers:

.. code-block:: python

    print(QgsApplication.rendererRegistry().renderersList())
    # Print:
    ['nullSymbol',
    'singleSymbol',
    'categorizedSymbol',
    'graduatedSymbol',
    'RuleRenderer',
    'pointDisplacement',
    'pointCluster',
    'invertedPolygonRenderer',
    'heatmapRenderer',
    '25dRenderer']

It is possible to obtain a dump of a renderer contents in text form --- can be
useful for debugging

.. code-block:: python

  print(renderer.dump())

.. index:: Single symbol renderer, Symbology; Single symbol renderer

Single Symbol Renderer
----------------------

You can get the symbol used for rendering by calling :func:`symbol` method and
change it with :func:`setSymbol` method (note for C++ devs: the renderer takes
ownership of the symbol.)

You can change the symbol used by a particular vector layer by calling
:func:`setSymbol()` passing an instance of the appropriate symbol instance.
Symbols for *point*, *line* and *polygon* layers can be created by calling
the :func:`createSimple` function of the corresponding classes
:class:`QgsMarkerSymbol`, :class:`QgsLineSymbol` and
:class:`QgsFillSymbol`.

The dictionary passed to :func:`createSimple` sets the style properties of the
symbol.

For example you can replace the symbol used by a particular **point** layer
by calling :func:`setSymbol()` passing an instance of a :class:`QgsMarkerSymbol`
as in the following code example:

.. code-block:: python

    symbol = QgsMarkerSymbol.createSimple({'name': 'square', 'color': 'red'})
    layer.renderer().setSymbol(symbol)
    # show the change
    layer.triggerRepaint()

``name`` indicates the shape of the marker, and can be any of the following:

* ``circle``
* ``square``
* ``cross``
* ``rectangle``
* ``diamond``
* ``pentagon``
* ``triangle``
* ``equilateral_triangle``
* ``star``
* ``regular_star``
* ``arrow``
* ``filled_arrowhead``
* ``x``


To get the full list of properties for the first symbol layer of a symbol
instance you can follow the example code:

.. code-block:: python

    print(layer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayers()[0].properties())
    # Prints
    {'angle': '0',
    'color': '0,128,0,255',
    'horizontal_anchor_point': '1',
    'joinstyle': 'bevel',
    'name': 'circle',
    'offset': '0,0',
    'offset_map_unit_scale': '0,0',
    'offset_unit': 'MM',
    'outline_color': '0,0,0,255',
    'outline_style': 'solid',
    'outline_width': '0',
    'outline_width_map_unit_scale': '0,0',
    'outline_width_unit': 'MM',
    'scale_method': 'area',
    'size': '2',
    'size_map_unit_scale': '0,0',
    'size_unit': 'MM',
    'vertical_anchor_point': '1'}

This can be useful if you want to alter some properties:

.. code-block:: python

    # You can alter a single property...
    layer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayer(0).setSize(3)
    # ... but not all properties are accessible from methods,
    # you can also replace the symbol completely:
    props = layer.renderer().symbol().symbolLayer(0).properties()
    props['color'] = 'yellow'
    props['name'] = 'square'
    layer.renderer().setSymbol(QgsMarkerSymbol.createSimple(props))
    # show the changes
    layer.triggerRepaint()


.. index:: Categorized symbology renderer, Symbology; Categorized symbol renderer

Categorized Symbol Renderer
---------------------------

You can query and set attribute name which is used for classification: use
:func:`classAttribute` and :func:`setClassAttribute` methods.

To get a list of categories

.. code-block:: python

  for cat in renderer.categories():
      print("{}: {} :: {}".format(cat.value(), cat.label(), cat.symbol()))

Where :func:`value` is the value used for discrimination between categories,
:func:`label` is a text used for category description and :func:`symbol` method
returns assigned symbol.

The renderer usually stores also original symbol and color ramp which were used
for the classification: :func:`sourceColorRamp` and :func:`sourceSymbol` methods.

.. index:: Symbology; Graduated symbol renderer, Graduated symbol renderer

Graduated Symbol Renderer
-------------------------

This renderer is very similar to the categorized symbol renderer described
above, but instead of one attribute value per class it works with ranges of
values and thus can be used only with numerical attributes.

To find out more about ranges used in the renderer

.. code-block:: python

  for ran in renderer.ranges():
      print("{} - {}: {} {}".format(
          ran.lowerValue(),
          ran.upperValue(),
          ran.label(),
          ran.symbol()
        ))

you can again use :func:`classAttribute` to find out classification attribute
name, :func:`sourceSymbol` and :func:`sourceColorRamp` methods.  Additionally
there is :func:`mode` method which determines how the ranges were created:
using equal intervals, quantiles or some other method.

If you wish to create your own graduated symbol renderer you can do so as
illustrated in the example snippet below (which creates a simple two class
arrangement)

.. code-block:: python

  from qgis.PyQt import QtGui

  myVectorLayer = QgsVectorLayer(myVectorPath, myName, 'ogr')
  myTargetField = 'target_field'
  myRangeList = []
  myOpacity = 1
  # Make our first symbol and range...
  myMin = 0.0
  myMax = 50.0
  myLabel = 'Group 1'
  myColour = QtGui.QColor('#ffee00')
  mySymbol1 = QgsSymbol.defaultSymbol(myVectorLayer.geometryType())
  mySymbol1.setColor(myColour)
  mySymbol1.setOpacity(myOpacity)
  myRange1 = QgsRendererRange(myMin, myMax, mySymbol1, myLabel)
  myRangeList.append(myRange1)
  #now make another symbol and range...
  myMin = 50.1
  myMax = 100
  myLabel = 'Group 2'
  myColour = QtGui.QColor('#00eeff')
  mySymbol2 = QgsSymbol.defaultSymbol(
       myVectorLayer.geometryType())
  mySymbol2.setColor(myColour)
  mySymbol2.setOpacity(myOpacity)
  myRange2 = QgsRendererRange(myMin, myMax, mySymbol2, myLabel)
  myRangeList.append(myRange2)
  myRenderer = QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer('', myRangeList)
  myRenderer.setMode(QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer.EqualInterval)
  myRenderer.setClassAttribute(myTargetField)

  myVectorLayer.setRenderer(myRenderer)
  QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(myVectorLayer)

.. index:: Symbols; Working with

Working with Symbols
--------------------

For representation of symbols, there is :class:`QgsSymbol` base class with
three derived classes:

* :class:`QgsMarkerSymbol` --- for point features
* :class:`QgsLineSymbol` --- for line features
* :class:`QgsFillSymbol` --- for polygon features

**Every symbol consists of one or more symbol layers** (classes derived from
:class:`QgsSymbolLayer`). The symbol layers do the actual rendering, the
symbol class itself serves only as a container for the symbol layers.

Having an instance of a symbol (e.g. from a renderer), it is possible to
explore it: :func:`type` method says whether it is a marker, line or fill
symbol. There is a :func:`dump` method which returns a brief description of
the symbol. To get a list of symbol layers

.. code-block:: python

  for i in range(symbol.symbolLayerCount()):
      lyr = symbol.symbolLayer(i)
      print("{}: {}".format(i, lyr.layerType()))

To find out symbol's color use :func:`color` method and :func:`setColor` to
change its color. With marker symbols additionally you can query for the symbol
size and rotation with :func:`size` and :func:`angle` methods, for line symbols
there is :func:`width` method returning line width.

Size and width are in millimeters by default, angles are in degrees.

.. index:: Symbol layers; Working with

Working with Symbol Layers
..........................

As said before, symbol layers (subclasses of :class:`QgsSymbolLayer`)
determine the appearance of the features.  There are several basic symbol layer
classes for general use. It is possible to implement new symbol layer types and
thus arbitrarily customize how features will be rendered. The :func:`layerType`
method uniquely identifies the symbol layer class --- the basic and default
ones are SimpleMarker, SimpleLine and SimpleFill symbol layers types.

You can get a complete list of the types of symbol layers you can create for a
given symbol layer class like this

.. code-block:: python

  from qgis.core import QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry
  myRegistry = QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry.instance()
  myMetadata = myRegistry.symbolLayerMetadata("SimpleFill")
  for item in myRegistry.symbolLayersForType(QgsSymbolV2.Marker):
      print(item)

Output

::

  EllipseMarker
  FontMarker
  SimpleMarker
  SvgMarker
  VectorField

:class:`QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry` class manages a database of all available
symbol layer types.

To access symbol layer data, use its :func:`properties` method that returns a
key-value dictionary of properties which determine the appearance. Each symbol
layer type has a specific set of properties that it uses. Additionally, there
are generic methods :func:`color`, :func:`size`, :func:`angle`, :func:`width`
with their setter counterparts. Of course size and angle is available only for
marker symbol layers and width for line symbol layers.

.. index:: Symbol layers; Creating custom types

Creating Custom Symbol Layer Types
..................................

Imagine you would like to customize the way how the data gets rendered. You can
create your own symbol layer class that will draw the features exactly as you
wish. Here is an example of a marker that draws red circles with specified
radius

.. code-block:: python

  class FooSymbolLayer(QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2):

    def __init__(self, radius=4.0):
        QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2.__init__(self)
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = QColor(255,0,0)

    def layerType(self):
       return "FooMarker"

    def properties(self):
        return { "radius" : str(self.radius) }

    def startRender(self, context):
      pass

    def stopRender(self, context):
        pass

    def renderPoint(self, point, context):
        # Rendering depends on whether the symbol is selected (QGIS >= 1.5)
        color = context.selectionColor() if context.selected() else self.color
        p = context.renderContext().painter()
        p.setPen(color)
        p.drawEllipse(point, self.radius, self.radius)

    def clone(self):
        return FooSymbolLayer(self.radius)


The :func:`layerType` method determines the name of the symbol layer, it has
to be unique among all symbol layers. Properties are used for persistence of
attributes. :func:`clone` method must return a copy of the symbol layer with
all attributes being exactly the same. Finally there are rendering methods:
:func:`startRender` is called before rendering first feature, :func:`stopRender`
when rendering is done. And :func:`renderPoint` method which does the rendering.
The coordinates of the point(s) are already transformed to the output
coordinates.

For polylines and polygons the only difference would be in the rendering
method: you would use :func:`renderPolyline` which receives a list of lines,
resp. :func:`renderPolygon` which receives list of points on outer ring as a
first parameter and a list of inner rings (or None) as a second parameter.

Usually it is convenient to add a GUI for setting attributes of the symbol
layer type to allow users to customize the appearance: in case of our example
above we can let user set circle radius. The following code implements such
widget

.. code-block:: python

    class FooSymbolLayerWidget(QgsSymbolLayerV2Widget):
        def __init__(self, parent=None):
            QgsSymbolLayerV2Widget.__init__(self, parent)

            self.layer = None

            # setup a simple UI
            self.label = QLabel("Radius:")
            self.spinRadius = QDoubleSpinBox()
            self.hbox = QHBoxLayout()
            self.hbox.addWidget(self.label)
            self.hbox.addWidget(self.spinRadius)
            self.setLayout(self.hbox)
            self.connect(self.spinRadius, SIGNAL("valueChanged(double)"), \
                self.radiusChanged)

        def setSymbolLayer(self, layer):
            if layer.layerType() != "FooMarker":
                return
            self.layer = layer
            self.spinRadius.setValue(layer.radius)

        def symbolLayer(self):
            return self.layer

        def radiusChanged(self, value):
            self.layer.radius = value
            self.emit(SIGNAL("changed()"))

This widget can be embedded into the symbol properties dialog. When the symbol
layer type is selected in symbol properties dialog, it creates an instance of
the symbol layer and an instance of the symbol layer widget. Then it calls
:func:`setSymbolLayer` method to assign the symbol layer to the widget. In that
method the widget should update the UI to reflect the attributes of the symbol
layer. :func:`symbolLayer` function is used to retrieve the symbol layer again
by the properties dialog to use it for the symbol.

On every change of attributes, the widget should emit :func:`changed()` signal
to let the properties dialog update the symbol preview.

Now we are missing only the final glue: to make QGIS aware of these new classes.
This is done by adding the symbol layer to registry. It is possible to use the
symbol layer also without adding it to the registry, but some functionality
will not work: e.g. loading of project files with the custom symbol layers or
inability to edit the layer's attributes in GUI.

We will have to create metadata for the symbol layer

.. code-block:: python

  class FooSymbolLayerMetadata(QgsSymbolLayerV2AbstractMetadata):

    def __init__(self):
      QgsSymbolLayerV2AbstractMetadata.__init__(self, "FooMarker", QgsSymbolV2.Marker)

    def createSymbolLayer(self, props):
      radius = float(props[QString("radius")]) if QString("radius") in props else 4.0
      return FooSymbolLayer(radius)

    def createSymbolLayerWidget(self):
      return FooSymbolLayerWidget()

  QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry.instance().addSymbolLayerType(FooSymbolLayerMetadata())

You should pass layer type (the same as returned by the layer) and symbol type
(marker/line/fill) to the constructor of parent class. :func:`createSymbolLayer`
takes care of creating an instance of symbol layer with attributes specified in
the `props` dictionary. (Beware, the keys are QString instances, not "str"
objects). And there is :func:`createSymbolLayerWidget` method which returns
settings widget for this symbol layer type.

The last step is to add this symbol layer to the registry --- and we are done.

.. index::
  pair: Custom; Renderer

Creating Custom Renderers
-------------------------

It might be useful to create a new renderer implementation if you would like to
customize the rules how to select symbols for rendering of features. Some use
cases where you would want to do it: symbol is determined from a combination of
fields, size of symbols changes depending on current scale etc.

The following code shows a simple custom renderer that creates two marker
symbols and chooses randomly one of them for every feature

.. code-block:: python

  import random

  class RandomRenderer(QgsFeatureRendererV2):
    def __init__(self, syms=None):
      QgsFeatureRendererV2.__init__(self, "RandomRenderer")
      self.syms = syms if syms else [QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(QGis.Point), QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(QGis.Point)]

    def symbolForFeature(self, feature):
      return random.choice(self.syms)

    def startRender(self, context, vlayer):
      for s in self.syms:
        s.startRender(context)

    def stopRender(self, context):
      for s in self.syms:
        s.stopRender(context)

    def usedAttributes(self):
      return []

    def clone(self):
      return RandomRenderer(self.syms)

The constructor of parent :class:`QgsFeatureRendererV2` class needs renderer
name (has to be unique among renderers). :func:`symbolForFeature` method is
the one that decides what symbol will be used for a particular feature.
:func:`startRender` and :func:`stopRender` take care of initialization/finalization
of symbol rendering. :func:`usedAttributes` method can return a list of field
names that renderer expects to be present. Finally :func:`clone` function
should return a copy of the renderer.

Like with symbol layers, it is possible to attach a GUI for configuration of
the renderer. It has to be derived from :class:`QgsRendererV2Widget`. The
following sample code creates a button that allows user to set symbol of the
first symbol

.. code-block:: python

  class RandomRendererWidget(QgsRendererV2Widget):
    def __init__(self, layer, style, renderer):
      QgsRendererV2Widget.__init__(self, layer, style)
      if renderer is None or renderer.type() != "RandomRenderer":
        self.r = RandomRenderer()
      else:
        self.r = renderer
      # setup UI
      self.btn1 = QgsColorButtonV2()
      self.btn1.setColor(self.r.syms[0].color())
      self.vbox = QVBoxLayout()
      self.vbox.addWidget(self.btn1)
      self.setLayout(self.vbox)
      self.connect(self.btn1, SIGNAL("clicked()"), self.setColor1)

    def setColor1(self):
      color = QColorDialog.getColor(self.r.syms[0].color(), self)
      if not color.isValid(): return
      self.r.syms[0].setColor(color)
      self.btn1.setColor(self.r.syms[0].color())

    def renderer(self):
      return self.r

The constructor receives instances of the active layer (:class:`QgsVectorLayer`),
the global style (:class:`QgsStyleV2`) and current renderer. If there is no
renderer or the renderer has different type, it will be replaced with our new
renderer, otherwise we will use the current renderer (which has already the
type we need). The widget contents should be updated to show current state of
the renderer. When the renderer dialog is accepted, widget's :func:`renderer`
method is called to get the current renderer --- it will be assigned to the
layer.

The last missing bit is the renderer metadata and registration in registry,
otherwise loading of layers with the renderer will not work and user will not
be able to select it from the list of renderers. Let us finish our
RandomRenderer example

.. code-block:: python

  class RandomRendererMetadata(QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata):
    def __init__(self):
      QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata.__init__(self, "RandomRenderer", "Random renderer")

    def createRenderer(self, element):
      return RandomRenderer()
    def createRendererWidget(self, layer, style, renderer):
      return RandomRendererWidget(layer, style, renderer)

  QgsRendererV2Registry.instance().addRenderer(RandomRendererMetadata())

Similarly as with symbol layers, abstract metadata constructor awaits renderer
name, name visible for users and optionally name of renderer's icon.
:func:`createRenderer` method passes :class:`QDomElement` instance that can be
used to restore renderer's state from DOM tree. :func:`createRendererWidget`
method creates the configuration widget. It does not have to be present or can
return `None` if the renderer does not come with GUI.

To associate an icon with the renderer you can assign it in
:class:`QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata` constructor as a third (optional)
argument --- the base class constructor in the RandomRendererMetadata :func:`__init__`
function becomes

.. code-block:: python

  QgsRendererV2AbstractMetadata.__init__(self,
         "RandomRenderer",
         "Random renderer",
         QIcon(QPixmap("RandomRendererIcon.png", "png")))

The icon can be associated also at any later time using :func:`setIcon` method
of the metadata class. The icon can be loaded from a file (as shown above) or
can be loaded from a `Qt resource <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html>`_
(PyQt5 includes .qrc compiler for Python).
