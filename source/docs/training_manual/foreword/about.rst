About the exercises
===================

How to use this tutorial
------------------------
Any text :guilabel:`that looks like this` refers to something that you can
see in the QGIS user interface.

Text that :menuselection:`looks --> like --> this` directs you through menus.

:kbd:`This kind of text` refers to something you can type, such as a command,
path, or file name.

Tiered course objectives
------------------------
This course caters to different user experience levels. Depending on which
category you consider yourself to be in, you can expect a different set of
course outcomes. Each category contains information that is essential for the
next one, so it's important to do all exercises that are at or below your level
of experience.

|basic| Basic
.............
In this category, the course assumes that you have little or no prior
experience with theoretical GIS knowledge or the operation of GIS software.

Limited theoretical background will be provided to explain the purpose of an
action you will be performing in the program, but the emphasis is on learning
by doing.

When you complete the course, you will have a better concept of the
possibilities of GIS, and how to harness their power via QGIS.

|moderate| Intermediate
.......................
In this category, it is assumed that you have working knowledge and experience
of the everyday uses of GIS software.

Building on the instructions for the beginner level will provide you with
familiar ground, as well as to make you aware of the cases where QGIS does
things slightly differently from other software you may be used to. You will
also learn how to use analysis functions in QGIS.

When you complete the course, you should be comfortable with using QGIS for all
of the functions you usually need for everyday use.
user_manual/index.html
|hard| Advanced
...............
In this category, the assumption is that you are experienced with GIS software,
have knowledge of and experience with spatial databases, using data on a remote
server, perhaps writing scripts for analysis purposes, etc.

Building on the instructions for the other two levels will familiarize you with
the approach that the QGIS interface follows, and will ensure that you know how
to access the basic functions that you need. You will also be shown how to make
use of the QGIS plugin system, database access, and so on.

When you complete the course, you should be well-acquainted with the everyday
operation of QGIS, as well as its more advanced functions.
