Preparing Exercise Data
=======================

The sample data provided with the Training Manual refers to the town of
|majorUrbanName| and its surroundings. |majorUrbanName| is located about 2 hours' east of
Cape Town in the Western Cape of South Africa. The dataset contains feature
names in both English and Afrikaans.

Anyone can use this dataset without difficulty, but you may prefer to use data
from your own country or home town. If you choose to do so, your localised
data will be used in all lessons from Module 3 to Module 7.2. Later modules use
more complex data sources which may or may not be available for your region.

.. note:: This process is intended for course conveners, or more experienced
  QGIS users who wish to create localised sample data sets for their course.
  Default data sets are provided with the Training Manual, but you may follow
  these instructions if you wish to replace the default data sets.

.. note:: The sample data used throughout the manual can be downloaded here:
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Training-Data/archive/QGIS-Training-Data-v1.0.zip.
   You can save the files in a folder named **exercise_data**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: These instructions assume you have a good knowledge of QGIS and are
  not intended to be used as teaching material.

If you wish to replace the default data set with localised data for your course,
this can easily be done with tools built into QGIS. The region you choose to use
should have a good mix of urban and rural areas, containing roads of differing
significance, area boundaries (such as nature reserves or farms) and surface
water, such as streams and rivers.

* Open a new QGIS project
* In the :guilabel:`Vector` menu dropdown, select
  :menuselection:`OpenStreetMap --> Download Data`. You can then manually enter the
  co-ordinates of the region you wish to use, or you can use an existing layer
  to set the co-ordinates.
* Choose a location to save the resulting .osm file and click :guilabel:`Ok`:

.. _figure_set_osm_region:

.. image:: img/set_osm_region.png
   :align: center

* You can then open the .osm file using the :guilabel:`Add Vector Layer` button.
  You may need to select :guilabel:`All files` in the browser window.
  Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file into the QGIS window.
* In the dialog which opens, select all the layers, *except* the
  :kbd:`other_relations` and :kbd:`multilinestrings` layer:

.. _figure_select_osm_layers:

.. image:: img/select_osm_layers.png
   :align: center

This will load three layers into your map which relate to OSM's naming
conventions (you may need to |zoomFullExtent| :sup:`Zoom Full` to see the
vector data).

.. _figure_osm_data_loaded:

.. image:: img/osm_data_loaded.png
   :align: center

We need to extract the useful data from these layers, rename them
and create corresponding shape files:

* First, double-click the :kbd:`multipolygons` layer to open the
  :guilabel:`Layer properties` dialog.
* In the :guilabel:`Source` tab, click :guilabel:`Query Builder` to open the
  :guilabel:`Query builder` window.

This layer contains three fields whose data we will need to extract for use
throughout the Training Manual:

* :kbd:`building`
* :kbd:`natural` (specifically, water)
* :kbd:`landuse`

You can sample the data your region contains in order to see what kind of
results your region will yield. If you find that "landuse" returns no results,
then feel free to exclude it.

You'll need to write filter expressions for each field to extract the data we
need. We'll use the "building" field as an example here:

* Enter the following expression into the text area:
  :kbd:`building != "NULL"` and click :guilabel:`Test` to see how many results
  the query will return. If the number of results is small, you may wish to
  have a look at the layer's :guilabel:`Attribute Table` to see what data OSM
  has returned for your region:

.. image:: img/building_query_builder.png
   :align: center

* Click :guilabel:`Ok` and you'll see that the layer elements which are not
  buildings have been removed from the map.

We now need to save the resulting data as a shapefile for you to use during your
course:

* Right-click the :guilabel:`multipolygons` layer and select
  :guilabel:`Save As...`
* Make sure the file type is :kbd:`ESRI Shapefile` and save the file in your
  new :kbd:`exercise_data` directory, under a directory called "epsg4326".
* Make sure :menuselection:`No Symbology` is selected (we'll add symbology as
  part of the course later on).
* You can also select :guilabel:`Add saved file to map`.

Once the :guilabel:`buildings` layer has been added to the map, you can repeat
the process for the :kbd:`natural` and :kbd:`landuse` fields using the following
expressions:

.. note:: Make sure you clear the previous filter (via the
   :guilabel:`Layer properties` dialog) from the
   :guilabel:`multipolygons` layer before proceeding with the next filter
   expression!

* :kbd:`natural`: "natural = 'water'"
* :kbd:`landuse`: "landuse != 'NULL'"

Each resulting data set should be saved in the "epsg4326" directory in your new
:kbd:`exercise_data` directory (i.e. "water", "landuse").

You should then extract and save the following fields from the :kbd:`lines` and
:kbd:`points` layers to their corresponding directories:

* :kbd:`lines`:
  "highway != 'NULL'" to :kbd:`roads`, and
  "waterway != 'NULL'" to :kbd:`rivers`
* :kbd:`points`:
  "place != 'NULL'" to :kbd:`places`

Once you have finished extracting the above data, you can remove the
:guilabel:`multipolygons`, :guilabel:`lines` and :guilabel:`points` layers.

You should now have a map which looks something like this (the symbology will
certainly be very different, but that is fine):

.. image:: img/post_osm_import.png
   :align: center

The important thing is that you have 6 layers matching those shown above and
that all those layers have some data.

The last step is to create a spatiallite file from the :kbd:`landuse` layer for
use during the course:

* Right-click the :kbd:`landuse` layer and select :menuselection:`Save as...`
* Select :menuselection:`SpatialLite` as the format and save the file as
  :kbd:`landuse` under the "epsg4326" directory.
* Click :menuselection:`Ok`.
* Delete the :kbd:`landuse.shp` and its related files (if created).


|hard| |TY| Create SRTM DEM tiff Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Module 6 (Creating Vector Data) and Module 8 (Rasters), you'll also need
raster images (SRTM DEM) which cover the region you have selected for your
course.

The CGIAR-CGI (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/) provides some SRTM DEM you can download
from http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp.

You'll need images which cover the entire region you have chosen to use.
If you kept same data as the training manual, you can use the extent shown
in the figure_set_osm_region_ figure above, otherwise adapt your extent.
Keep the :file:`GeoTiff` format. Once the form is filled, click on the
:guilabel:`Click here to Begin Search >>` button and download the file(s).

Once you have downloaded the required file(s), they should be saved in the
:file:`exercise_data` directory, under :file:`raster/SRTM` subfolders.

|hard| |TY| Create imagery tiff Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Module 6, Lesson 1.2 shows close-up images of three school sports fields
which students are asked to digitize. You'll therefore need to reproduce these
images using your new SRTM DEM tiff file(s). There is no obligation to use school
sports fields: any three school land-use types can be used (e.g. different
school buildings, playgrounds or car parks).

For reference, the images in the example data are:

.. image:: img/field_outlines.png
   :align: center


.. image:: img/school_area_one.png
   :align: center


|basic| |TY| Replace Tokens
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having created your localised dataset, the final step is to replace the tokens
in the :kbd:`conf.py` file so that the appropriate names will appear in your
localised version of the Training Manual.

The tokens you need to replace are as follows:

* :kbd:`majorUrbanName`: this defaults to "Swellendam". Replace with the name of
  the major town in your region.
* :kbd:`schoolAreaType1`: this defaults to "athletics field". Replace with the
  name of the largest school area type in your region.
* :kbd:`largeLandUseArea`: this defaults to "Bontebok National Park". Replace
  with the name of a large landuse polygon in your region.
* :kbd:`srtmFileName`: this defaults to :kbd:`srtm_41_19.tif`. Replace this with
  the filename of your SRTM DEM file.
* :kbd:`localCRS`: this defaults to :kbd:`WGS 84 / UTM 34S`. You should replace
  this with the correct CRS for your region.
