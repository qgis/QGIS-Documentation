Background
----------

In 2008 we launched the `Gentle Introduction to GIS
<http://linfiniti.com/dla>`_, a completely free, open content resource for
people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon and new
terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and has been a
phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to us to tell us how
they are using the materials to run University Training Courses, teach
themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software tutorial,
but rather aims to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all examples)
for someone learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual which provides a
detailed functional overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not
structured as a tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti
Consulting CC. we frequently run training courses and have realised that a
third resource is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through
learning the key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted
us to produce this work.

This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to run a 5
day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured with
content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has many
exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text.
