|LS| Spatial Statistics
===============================================================================

.. note:: Lesson developed by Linfiniti and S Motala (Cape Peninsula University
   of Technology)

Spatial statistics allow you to analyze and understand what is going on in a
given vector dataset. QGIS includes several standard tools for statistical
analysis which prove useful in this regard.

**The goal for this lesson:** To know how to use QGIS' spatial statistics
tools.

|basic| |FA| Create a Test Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to get a point dataset to work with, we'll create a random set of
points.

To do so, you'll need a polygon dataset defining the extents of the area you
want to create the points in.

We'll use the area covered by streets.

* Create a new empty map.
* Add your :kbd:`roads_34S` layer,
  as well as the |srtmFileName| raster (elevation data) found in
  :kbd:`exercise_data/raster/SRTM/`.

.. note:: You might find that your SRTM DEM layer has a different CRS to that of
  the roads layer. If so, you can reproject either the roads or DEM layer using
  techniques learnt earlier in this module.

* Use the :guilabel:`Convex hull(s)` tool (available under
  :menuselection:`Vector --> Geoprocessing Tools`) to generate an area
  enclosing all the roads:

.. image:: img/roads_hull_setup.png
   :align: center

* Save the output under :kbd:`exercise_data/spatial_statistics/` as
  :kbd:`roads_hull.shp`.
* Check :guilabel:`Add result to canvas` option to add the output to the TOC (:guilabel:`Layers list`).

Creating random points
...............................................................................

* Create random points in this area using the tool at :menuselection:`Vector
  --> Research Tools --> Random points`:

.. image:: img/random_points_setup.png
   :align: center

* Save the output under :kbd:`exercise_data/spatial_statistics/` as
  :kbd:`random_points.shp`.
* Check :guilabel:`Add result to canvas` option to add the output to the TOC (:guilabel:`Layers list`).

.. image:: img/random_points_result.png
   :align: center

Sampling the data
...............................................................................

* To create a sample dataset from the raster, you'll need to use the
  :guilabel:`Point sampling tool` plugin.
* Refer ahead to the module on plugins if necessary.
* Search for the phrase :kbd:`point sampling` in the :menuselection:`Plugin -->
  Manage and Install Plugins...` and you will find the plugin.
* As soon as it has been activated with the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`, you
  will find the tool under :menuselection:`Plugins --> Analyses --> Point
  sampling tool`:

.. image:: img/sampling_plugin_dialog.png
   :align: center

* Select :guilabel:`random_points` as the layer containing sampling points, and
  the SRTM raster as the band to get values from.
* Make sure that "Add created layer to the TOC" is checked.
* Save the output under :kbd:`exercise_data/spatial_statistics/` as
  :kbd:`random_samples.shp`.

Now you can check the sampled data from the raster file in the attributes
table of the :guilabel:`random_samples` layer, they will be in a column
named |srtmFileName|.

A possible sample layer is shown here:

.. image:: img/random_samples_result.png
   :align: center

The sample points are classified by their value such that darker points are at
a lower altitude.

You'll be using this sample layer for the rest of the statistical exercises.

|basic| |FA| Basic Statistics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now get the basic statistics for this layer.

* Click on the :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools --> Basic statistics`
  menu entry.
* In the dialog that appears, specify the :guilabel:`random_samples` layer as
  the source.
* Make sure that the :menuselection:`Target field` is set to |srtmFileName|
  which is the field you will calculate statistics for.
* Click :guilabel:`OK`. You'll get results like this:

.. image:: img/basic_statistics_results.png
   :align: center

.. note:: You can copy and paste the results into a spreadsheet. The data uses
   a (colon :kbd:`:`) separator.

.. image:: img/paste_to_spreadsheet.png
   :align: center

* Close the plugin dialog when done.

To understand the statistics above, refer to this definition list:

Mean
  The mean (average) value is simply the sum of the values divided by the
  amount of values.

StdDev
  The standard deviation. Gives an indication of how closely the values are
  clustered around the mean. The smaller the standard deviation, the closer
  values tend to be to the mean.

Sum
  All the values added together.

Min
  The minimum value.

Max
  The maximum value.

N
  The amount of samples/values.

CV
  The `spatial <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_covariance>`_ `covariance
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance>`_ of the dataset.

Number of unique values
  The number of values that are unique across this dataset. If there are 90
  unique values in a dataset with N=100, then the 10 remaining values are the
  same as one or more of each other.

Range
  The difference between the minimum and maximum values.

Median
  If you arrange all the values from least to greatest, the middle value (or
  the average of the two middle values, if N is an even number) is the median
  of the values.

|basic| |FA| Compute a Distance Matrix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create a new point layer in the same projection as the other datasets
  (|localCRS|).
* Enter edit mode and digitize three point somewhere among the other points.
* Alternatively, use the same random point generation method as before, but
  specify only three points.
* Save your new layer as :kbd:`distance_points.shp`.

To generate a distance matrix using these points:

* Open the tool :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools --> Distance matrix`.
* Select the :guilabel:`distance_points` layer as the input layer, and the
  :guilabel:`random_samples` layer as the target layer.
* Set it up like this:

.. image:: img/distance_matrix_setup.png
   :align: center
   
* Save the result as :kbd:`distance_matrix.csv`.
* Click :guilabel:`OK` to generate the distance matrix.
* Open it in a spreadsheet program to see the results. Here is an example:

.. image:: img/distance_matrix_example.png
   :align: center

|basic| |FA| Nearest Neighbor Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do a nearest neighbor analysis:

* Click on the menu item :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools --> Nearest
  neighbor analysis`.
* In the dialog that appears, select the :guilabel:`random_samples` layer and
  click :guilabel:`OK`.
* The results will appear in the dialog's text window, for example:

.. image:: img/nearest_neighbour_example.png
   :align: center

.. note:: You can copy and paste the results into a spreadsheet. The data uses
   a (colon :kbd:`:`) separator.

|basic| |FA| Mean Coordinates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get the mean coordinates of a dataset:

* Click on the :menuselection:`Vector --> Analysis Tools --> Mean
  coordinate(s)` menu item.
* In the dialog that appears, specify :guilabel:`random_samples` as the input
  layer, but leave the optional choices unchanged.
* Specify the output layer as :kbd:`mean_coords.shp`.
* Click :guilabel:`OK`.
* Add the layer to the :guilabel:`Layers list` when prompted.

Let's compare this to the central coordinate of the polygon that was used to
create the random sample.

* Click on the :menuselection:`Vector --> Geometry Tools --> Polygon centroids`
  menu item.
* In the dialog that appears, select :guilabel:`roads_hull` as the input layer.
* Save the result as :kbd:`center_point`.
* Add it to the :guilabel:`Layers list` when prompted.

As you can see from the example below, the mean coordinates and the center of
the study area (in orange) don't necessarily coincide:

.. image:: img/polygon_centroid_mean.png
   :align: center

|basic| |FA| Image Histograms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The histogram of a dataset shows the distribution of its values. The simplest
way to demonstrate this in QGIS is via the image histogram, available in the
:guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog of any image layer.

* In your :guilabel:`Layers list`, right-click on the SRTM DEM layer.
* Select :menuselection:`Properties`.
* Choose the tab :guilabel:`Histogram`. You may need to click on the
  :guilabel:`Compute Histogram` button to generate the graphic. You will see a
  graph describing the frequency of values in the image.
* You can export it as an image:

.. image:: img/histogram_export.png
   :align: center
   
* Select the :guilabel:`Metadata` tab, you can see more detailed information
  inside the :guilabel:`Properties` box.

The mean value is :kbd:`332.8`, and the maximum value is :kbd:`1699`! But those
values don't show up on the histogram. Why not? It's because there are so few
of them, compared to the abundance of pixels with values below the mean. That's
also why the histogram extends so far to the right, even though there is no
visible red line marking the frequency of values higher than about :kbd:`250`.

Therefore, keep in mind that a histogram shows you the distribution of values,
and not all values are necessarily visible on the graph.

* (You may now close :guilabel:`Layer Properties`.)

|basic| |FA| Spatial Interpolation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you have a collection of sample points from which you would like to
extrapolate data. For example, you might have access to the
:guilabel:`random_samples` dataset we created earlier, and would like to have
some idea of what the terrain looks like.

To start, launch the :guilabel:`Grid (Interpolation)` tool by clicking on the
:menuselection:`Raster --> Analysis --> Grid (Interpolation)` menu item.

* In the :guilabel:`Input file` field, select :kbd:`random_samples`.
* Check the :guilabel:`Z Field` box, and select the field :kbd:`srtm_41_19`.
* Set the :guilabel:`Output file` location to
  :kbd:`exercise_data/spatial_statistics/interpolation.tif`.
* Check the :guilabel:`Algorithm` box and select :guilabel:`Inverse distance to
  a power`.
* Set the :guilabel:`Power` to :kbd:`5.0` and the :guilabel:`Smoothing` to
  :kbd:`2.0`. Leave the other values as-is.
* Check the :guilabel:`Load into canvas when finished` box and click
  :guilabel:`OK`.
* When it's done, click :guilabel:`OK` on the dialog that says
  :kbd:`Process completed`, click :guilabel:`OK` on the dialog showing feedback
  information (if it has appeared), and click :guilabel:`Close` on the
  :guilabel:`Grid (Interpolation)` dialog.

Here's a comparison of the original dataset (left) to the one constructed from
our sample points (right). Yours may look different due to the random nature of
the location of the sample points.

.. image:: img/interpolation_comparison.png
   :align: center

As you can see, 100 sample points aren't really enough to get a detailed
impression of the terrain. It gives a very general idea, but it can be
misleading as well. For example, in the image above, it is not clear that there
is a high, unbroken mountain running from east to west; rather, the image seems
to show a valley, with high peaks to the west. Just using visual inspection, we
can see that the sample dataset is not representative of the terrain.

|moderate| |TY|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use the processes shown above to create a new set of :kbd:`1000` random points.
* Use these points to sample the original DEM.
* Use the :guilabel:`Grid (Interpolation)` tool on this new dataset as above.
* Set the output filename to :kbd:`interpolation_1000.tif`, with
  :guilabel:`Power` and :guilabel:`Smoothing` set to :kbd:`5.0` and :kbd:`2.0`,
  respectively.

The results (depending on the positioning of your random points) will look more
or less like this:

.. image:: img/interpolation_comparison_1000.png
   :align: center

The border shows the :guilabel:`roads_hull` layer (which represents the
boundary of the random sample points) to explain the sudden lack of detail
beyond its edges. This is a much better representation of the terrain, due to
the much greater density of sample points.

Here is an example of what it looks like with :kbd:`10 000` sample points:

.. image:: img/011.png
   :align: center

.. note:: It's not recommended that you try doing this with 10 000 sample
   points if you are not working on a fast computer, as the size of the sample
   dataset requires a lot of processing time.

|moderate| |FA| Additional Spatial Analysis Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Originally a separate project and then accessible as a plugin, the SEXTANTE software
has been added to QGIS as a core function from version 2.0. You can find it as
a new QGIS menu with its new name :menuselection:`Processing` from where you can
access a rich toolbox of spatial analysis tools allows you to access various plugin
tools from within a single interface.

* Activate this set of tools by enabling the :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`
  menu entry. The toolbox looks like this:

.. image:: img/sextante_toolbox.png
   :align: center

You will probably see it docked in QGIS to the right of the map. Note that the
tools listed here are links to the actual tools. Some of them are SEXTANTE's
own algorithms and others are links to tools that are accessed from external
applications such as GRASS, SAGA or the Orfeo Toolbox. This external applications
are installed with QGIS so you are already able to make use of them.
In case you need to change the configuration of the Processing tools or,
for example, you need to update to a new version of one of the external
applications, you can access its setting from
:menuselection:`Processing --> Options and configurations`.


|moderate| |FA| Spatial Point Pattern Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a simple indication of the spatial distribution of points in the
:guilabel:`random_samples` dataset, we can make use of SAGA's
:guilabel:`Spatial Point Pattern Analysis` tool via the
:guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` you just opened.

* In the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`, search for this tool  :guilabel:`Spatial
  Point Pattern Analysis`.
* Double-click on it to open its dialog.

Installing SAGA
................................................................................

.. note:: If SAGA is not installed on your system, the plugin's dialog will
  inform you that the dependency is missing. If this is not the case, you can
  skip these steps.

On Windows
...............................................................................

Included in your course materials you will find the SAGA installer for Windows.

* Start the program and follow its instructions to install SAGA on your Windows
  system. Take note of the path you are installing it under!

Once you have installed SAGA, you'll need to configure SEXTANTE to find the
path it was installed under.

* Click on the menu entry :menuselection:`Analysis --> SAGA options and
  configuration`.
* In the dialog that appears, expand the :guilabel:`SAGA` item and look for
  :guilabel:`SAGA folder`. Its value will be blank.
* In this space, insert the path where you installed SAGA.

On Ubuntu
...............................................................................

* Search for :guilabel:`SAGA GIS` in the :guilabel:`Software Center`, or enter
  the phrase :kbd:`sudo apt-get install saga-gis` in your terminal. (You may
  first need to add a SAGA repository to your sources.)
* QGIS will find SAGA automatically, although you may need to restart QGIS if
  it doesn't work straight away.

On Mac
................................................................................

Homebrew users can install SAGA with this command:

* brew install saga-core

If you do not use Homebrew, please follow the instructions here:

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X

After installing
................................................................................

Now that you have installed and configured SAGA, its functions will become
accessible to you.

Using SAGA
................................................................................

* Open the SAGA dialog.
* SAGA produces three outputs, and so will require three output paths.
* Save these three outputs under :kbd:`exercise_data/spatial_statistics/`,
  using whatever file names you find appropriate.

.. image:: img/002.png
   :align: center

The output will look like this (the symbology was changed for this example):

.. image:: img/003.png
   :align: center

The red dot is the mean center; the large circle is the standard distance,
which gives an indication of how closely the points are distributed around the
mean center; and the rectangle is the bounding box, describing the smallest
possible rectangle which will still enclose all the points.

|moderate| |FA| Minimum Distance Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often, the output of an algorithm will not be a shapefile, but rather a table
summarizing the statistical properties of a dataset. One of these is the
:guilabel:`Minimum Distance Analysis` tool.

* Find this tool in the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` as :guilabel:`Minimum
  Distance Analysis`.

It does not require any other input besides specifying the vector point dataset
to be analyzed.

* Choose the :guilabel:`random_points` dataset.
* Click :guilabel:`OK`. On completion, a DBF table will appear in the
  :guilabel:`Layers list`.
* Select it, then open its attribute table. Although the figures may vary, your
  results will be in this format:

.. image:: img/min_distance_results.png
   :align: center

|IC|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QGIS allows many possibilities for analyzing the spatial statistical properties
of datasets.

|WN|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we've covered vector analysis, why not see what can be done with
rasters? That's what we'll do in the next module!
