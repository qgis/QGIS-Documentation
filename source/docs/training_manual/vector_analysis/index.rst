Now that you have edited a few features, you must want to know what else one
can do with them. Having features with attributes is nice, but when all is said
and done, this doesn't really tell you anything that a normal, non-GIS map
can't.

The key advantage of a GIS is this: *a GIS can answer questions.*

For the next three modules, we'll endeavor to answer a *research question*
using GIS functions. Suppose you are a property developer, and you want to
build a new residential development. You need to buy a farm to build it on.
Your market research has given you the following criteria. The farm must:

- be at least a certain area in size;
- be within the Swellendam town region;
- have a road running through it for easy access;
- be within a certain distance from a school;
- be on a flat surface for easy construction of new buildings; and
- stay out of the shadow of the mountains in winter.

Within the next few modules, we'll harness the power of GIS analysis tools to
locate suitable farm properties for this new residential development.
