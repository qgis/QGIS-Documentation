|LS| Working with Vector Data
===============================================================================

Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily
use of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points, that may be
connected into lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is called a
**feature**, and is associated with data that describes that feature.

**The goal for this lesson:** To learn about the structure of vector data, and
how to load vector datasets into a map.

|basic| |FA| Viewing Layer Attributes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's important to know that the data you will be working with does not only
represent **where** objects are in space, but also tells you **what** those
objects are.

From the previous exercise, you should have the :guilabel:`roads` layer
loaded in your map. What you can see right now is merely the position of the
roads.

To see all the data available to you, with the :guilabel:`roads` layer
selected in the Layers panel:

* Click on this button: |openTable|

It will show you a table with more data about the :guilabel:`roads` layer.
This extra data is called *attribute data*. The lines that you can see on your
map represent where the roads go; this is the *spatial data*.

These definitions are commonly used in GIS, so it's essential to remember them!

* You may now close the attribute table.

Vector data represents features in terms of points, lines and polygons on a
coordinate plane. It is usually used to store discrete features, like roads and
city blocks.


.. _backlink-vector-load-shapefiles-1:

|basic| |FA| Loading Vector Data From Shapefiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Shapefile is a specific file format that allows you to store GIS data in an
associated group of files. Each layer consists of several files with the same
name, but different file types. Shapefiles are easy to send back and forth, and
most GIS software can read them.

Refer back to the introductory exercise in the previous section for
instructions on how to add vector layers.

Load the data sets from the :file:`epsg4326` folder into your map following the
same method:

* "places"
* "water"
* "rivers"
* "buildings"

:ref:`Check your results <vector-load-shapefiles-1>`


.. _backlink-vector-load-from-database-1:

|basic| |FA| Loading Vector Data From a Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Databases allow you to store a large volume of associated data in one file. You
may already be familiar with a database management system (DBMS) such as
Microsoft Access. GIS applications can also make use of databases. GIS-specific
DBMSes (such as PostGIS) have extra functions, because they need to handle
spatial data.

* Click on this icon: |addSpatiaLiteLayer|

(If you're sure you can't see it at all, check that the :guilabel:`Manage
Layers` toolbar is enabled.)

It will give you a new dialog. In this dialog:

* Click the :guilabel:`New` button.
* In the same :file:`epsg4326` folder, you should find the file
  :file:`landuse.sqlite`. Select it and click :guilabel:`Open`.

You will now see the first dialog again. Notice that the dropdown select above
the three buttons now reads "landuse.sqlite@...", followed by the path of the
database file on your computer.

* Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button. You should see this in the previously
  empty box:

.. image:: img/spatiallite_dialog_connected.png
   :align: center

* Click on the :kbd:`landuse` layer to select it, then click
  :menuselection:`Add`

.. note::  Remember to save the map often! The map file doesn't contain any of
   the data directly, but it remembers which layers you loaded into your map.

:ref:`Check your results <vector-load-from-database-1>`


|FA| Reordering the Layers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layers in your Layers list are drawn on the map in a certain order. The
layer at the bottom of the list is drawn first, and the layer at the top is
drawn last. By changing the order that they are shown on the list, you can
change the order they are drawn in.

.. note::  Depending on the version of QGIS that you are using, you may have a
   checkbox beneath your Layers list reading :guilabel:`Control rendering
   order`. This must be checked (switched on) so that moving the layers up and
   down in the Layers list will bring them to the front or send them to the
   back in the map. If your version of QGIS doesn't have this option, then it
   is switched on by default and you don't need to worry about it.

The order in which the layers have been loaded into the map is probably not
logical at this stage. It's possible that the road layer is completely hidden
because other layers are on top of it.

For example, this layer order...

.. image:: img/incorrect_layer_order.png
   :align: center

... would result in roads and places being hidden as they run *underneath*
urban areas.

To resolve this problem:

* Click and drag on a layer in the Layers list.
* Reorder them to look like this:

.. image:: img/correct_layer_order.png
   :align: center

You'll see that the map now makes more sense visually, with roads and buildings
appearing above the land use regions.

|IC|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you've added all the layers you need from several different sources.

|WN|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the random palette automatically assigned when loading the layers, your
current map is probably not easy to read. It would be preferable to assign your
own choice of colors and symbols. This is what you'll learn to do in the next
lesson.


.. Substitutions definitions - AVOID EDITING PAST THIS LINE
   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
   source folder.
