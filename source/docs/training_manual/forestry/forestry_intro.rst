|LS| Forestry Module Presentation
===============================================================================

Following this module about a forestry application requires the knowledge you have learned through the modules 1 to 11 of this training manual. The exercises in the following lessons assume you are already capable of doing many of the basic operations in QGIS and only tools that have not been used before are presented in more detail.

Nevertheless, the module follows a basic level throughout the lessons so that if you have previous experience with QGIS, you can probably follow the instructions without problems.

Note that you need to download an additional data package for this module. 

Forestry Sample Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: The sample data used in this module can be downloaded `here  (125 Mb) <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3200993/forestry_data.zip>`_.
   Download the zip file and extract the :kbd:`forestry\\` folder into your :kbd:`exercise_data\\` folder.

The forestry related sample data (forestry map, forest data), has been provided by the `EVO-HAMK forestry school <http://www.hamk.fi/tietoa-hamkista/kartat-ja-toimipaikat/Sivut/evo.aspx>`_. The datasets have been modified to adapt to the lessons needs.

The general sample data (aerial images, LiDAR data, basic maps) has been obtained from the National Land Survey of Finland open data service, and adapted for the purposes of the exercises. The open data file download service can be accessed in English `here <http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/file_download_service>`_.


.. warning::

   As for the rest of the training manual, this module includes instructions on adding,
   deleting and altering GIS datasets. We have provided training datasets for this purpose.
   Before using the techniques described here on your own data, always ensure you have
   proper backups!
