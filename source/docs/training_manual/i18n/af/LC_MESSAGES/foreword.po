"In 2008 we launched the `Gentle Introduction to GIS <http://linfiniti.com/"
"dla>`_, a completely free, open content resource for people who want to "
"learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon and new terminology. It "
"was sponsored by the South African government and has been a phenomenal "
"success, with people all over the world writing to us to tell us how they "
"are using the materials to run University Training Courses, teach themselves "
"GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software tutorial, but "
"rather aims to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all examples) for "
"someone learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual which provides a "
"detailed functional overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not "
"structured as a tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti "
"Consulting CC. we frequently run training courses and have realised that a "
"third resource is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through "
"learning the key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which "
"prompted us to produce this work."

"This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to run "
"a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured "
"with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has "
"many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text."
