"`Label tool` has many other useful functions. You can set scale-based "
"rendering, alter the rendering priority for labels in a layer, and set every "
"label option using layer attributes. You can even set the rotation, XY "
"position, and other properties of a label (if you have attribute fields "
"allocated for the purpose), then edit these properties using the tools "
"adjacent to the main :guilabel:`Label tool`:"
