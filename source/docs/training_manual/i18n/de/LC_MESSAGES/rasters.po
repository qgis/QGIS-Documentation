"This is what was expected: a simplified version of the earlier results. "
"Remember that if the results you get from a tool aren't what you expected, "
"viewing the metadata (and vector attributes, if applicable) can prove "
"essential to solving the problem."

"You've seen how to derive all kinds of analysis products from a DEM. These "
"include hillshade, slope and aspect calculations. You've also seen how to "

"Now you have two analyses: the vector analysis which shows you the "
"potentially suitable farms, and the raster analysis that shows you the "
"potentially suitable terrain. How can these be combined to arrive at a final "
"result for this problem? That's the topic for the next lesson, starting in "
"the next module."
