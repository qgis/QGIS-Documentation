"Up to now, none of the changes we have made to the map have been influenced "
"by the objects that are being shown. In other words, all the farms look "
"alike, and all the roads look alike. When looking at the map, the viewers "
"don't know anything about the roads they are seeing; only that there is a "
"road of a certain shape in a certain area."

"But the whole strength of GIS is that all the objects that are visible on "
"the map, also have attributes. Maps in a GIS aren't just pictures. They "
"represent not only objects in locations, but also information about those "
