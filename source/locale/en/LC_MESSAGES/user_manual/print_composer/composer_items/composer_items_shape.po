"The :guilabel:`Shape` item is a tool that helps to decorate your map with"
" regular shapes like triangle, rectangle, ellipse... You can add a "
"regular shape using the |addBasicShape| :sup:`Add Shape` tool which gives"
" access to particular tools like |addBasicRectangle| :sup:`Add "
"Rectangle`, |addBasicCircle| :sup:`Add Ellipse` and |addBasicTriangle| "
":sup:`Add Triangle`. Once you have selected the appropriate tool, you can"
" draw the item following :ref:`items creation instructions "
"<create_layout_item>`. Like other layout items, a regular shape can be "
"manipulated the same way as exposed in :ref:`interact_layout_item`."
